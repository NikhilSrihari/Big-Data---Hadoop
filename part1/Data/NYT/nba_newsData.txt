"I have had a basketball in my hand basically since the day I was born. My dream has always been to play in the NBA. Therefore, after speaking with my family and coaches and giving it a lot of thought, I know it's the right time to announce that I will be entering the NBA draft and signing with an agent."Jerome knows it's the right time because he's "as ready as I'm going to be," he said in a subsequent interview with Sports Illustrated.Jerome averaged 13.6 points, 5.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game last season. He was Virginia's primary ballhandler but was technically the starting 2-guard for the Cavaliers. He said he patterns his game after a combination of Steve Nash and Klay Thompson.The Cavaliers are bracing to lose Jerome and sophomore forward De'Andre Hunter from a team that lost only three games last season.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

Milwaukee was the only team in the league to rank in the top four in both offensive and defensive rating.Budenholzer was one of eight coaches to receive votes from NBA peers this season. The others were Brooklyn's Kenny Atkinson, Denver's Michael Malone, Indiana's Nate McMillan, San Antonio's Gregg Popovich, the Los Angeles Clippers' Doc Rivers, Utah's Quin Snyder and Portland's Terry Stotts.The NBCA award is voted on by the league's 30 head coaches. This is the third season where it was awarded; Mike D'Antoni and Erik Spoelstra shared the award in 2017 and Dwane Casey won it last season.The award is separate from the NBA's coach of the year award. That winner will be announced at the NBA Awards Show in Los Angeles on June 24.Advertisement

Instead, Virginia held on for an 80-75 win in overtime on March 30.In a Twitter post, Edwards handed out thank-yous all around, and then said, "For as long as I can remember, it has been a dream to play in the NBA. I feel that the time is now," adding that he is "ready for the next chapter in my life."Edwards led the Big Ten Conference in scoring, averaging 24.3 points, and he also tallied 3.6 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game this season. He was a consensus second-team All-America selection.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThere's no LeBron James in these playoffs, so the NBA Finals will have a distinctly new look for the first time in nine years.There's no Tony Parker, for the first time in nearly two decades.There's no Dwyane Wade, and he'll never play a playoff game again.San Antonio is in the postseason for a record-tying 22nd consecutive season. Brooklyn, Denver, Detroit, Orlando and the Los Angeles Clippers got into these playoffs after watching the postseason last year.As always at playoff time, there are some familiar things and some not-so-familiar things. With the postseason set to begin Saturday, here's 10 things to know going into the best time of the NBA year:DRIVE FOR FIVEGolden State is trying to reach the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive season.If the Warriors get there, they would be the second franchise ever with such a streak — joining only the Boston Celtics, who went there in 10 straight seasons from 1957-66.The Warriors are one of five franchises with a streak of four straight NBA Finals trips: the Los Angeles Lakers did it from 1982-85, the Celtics also did it from 1984-87, the Miami Heat did it from 2011-14 and the Cleveland Cavaliers did it from 2015-18.Golden State is also seeking its seventh championship in franchise history. That would put the Warriors in sole possession of third place on the NBA's most-titles list, behind Boston (17) and the Lakers (16).The Warriors and Chicago are currently tied for third with six championships each.BLOWOUT BUCKSMilwaukee had 45 double-digit wins this season, the most in the NBA.That's a really good omen for the Bucks.Only four teams in NBA history have posted more double-digit wins in a regular season than the Bucks this year. Those clubs are the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers (50), the 2016-17 Golden State Warriors (48), the 1970-71 Bucks (47) and the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls (46).All four of those teams went on to win the NBA championship.MR. 3000?Houston's James Harden scored 2,818 points in the regular season, which puts him on the cusp of joining a very elite club.If Harden scores 182 in the playoffs, that will give him a total of 3,000 — and he would be the 10th player in NBA history to score that many in a full season, postseason included. The others: Michael Jordan (10 times), Wilt Chamberlain (five times), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Rick Barry, Elgin Baylor, Kobe Bryant, Kevin Durant, Bob McAdoo and Shaquille O'Neal.Durant was the last to do it, in 2013-14.LeBron James almost got into the club last year, coming as close as humanly possible — he scored 2,999 points for Cleveland.WELCOME BACKKawhi Leonard's last postseason appearance ended earlier than planned, when he hurt his left ankle while taking a jumper over Golden State's Zaza Pachulia in Game 1 of the 2017 Western Conference finals. Pachulia closed out aggressively, Leonard didn't have space to land safely and he missed the rest of that series.When Leonard left the game, he and San Antonio were up by 23. The Spurs lost that lead, lost the game, lost the series and Leonard never played a postseason second with the Spurs again after that bad landing.Toronto is hoping that Leonard can rekindle his typical postseason magic in his playoff return.Leonard enters these playoffs with a 32-game streak of double-digit postseason outings, averaging 24.1 points in those contests.STEPH RISINGWarriors guard Stephen Curry is on pace to catch Ray Allen and become the NBA's all-time 3-point leader sometime in the 2020-21 season.That stat only takes regular-season games into account. In the postseason, Curry is about to become No. 1.Curry has 378 career postseason 3s, good for No. 2 on the NBA's all-time playoff list. Allen is No. 1, with 385.PLAYOFF CASHThe 16 playoff teams are playing for the Larry O'Brien Trophy, for rings, for a parade ... and for a stake of $21,676,510.That's the amount of this year's NBA Playoff Pool — a record.Every playoff team is assured of some of the pie, which is often used to fund bonuses for players and team staff.So far, all 16 teams are due at least $323,506 each. Most have already clinched much more because finishing in the top six spots in each conference also comes with a bonus. For example, Milwaukee — because it had the best record in the NBA — is already due $1,495,750.Teams get an additional $384,930 for winning a first-round series. Conference finalists get another $638,094. The losing team in the NBA Finals gets another $2,543,681 and the NBA champs get one more payout of $3,838,798.Add it all up, and the Bucks could get $6,355,572 if they win the title. No other team can win that much.HOUSTON, A PROBLEM?Houston is the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference, and faces No. 5 seed Utah in the first round.History suggests the Rockets are in trouble.In each of the last seven seasons, and nine of the last 10, the No. 5 team in the West has beaten the No. 4 team in the first round.Utah has won each of its last five appearances in a 4-versus-5 series. The fifth-seeded Jazz knocked off Oklahoma City in 2018, the Los Angeles Clippers in 2017 and Denver in 2010. The Jazz were seeded No. 4 when they won a 4-versus-5 series in 2007 and 2008 — both of those coming against Houston.BOOGIE'S DEBUTDeMarcus Cousins is No. 1 on a list that nobody wants to lead.By this weekend, he'll be off the list entirely.Cousins has played in 565 regular-season games and zero postseason games. That'll change this weekend when he and Golden State play host to the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 1 of a Western Conference first-round series.No active NBA player has been in more regular-season games without a playoff appearance than Cousins. When he plays for the Warriors this weekend, and when Kyle O'Quinn — currently No. 2 on the list with 443 regular-season games without a postseason minute — plays for Indiana, the new active leader in games played without a postseason appearance will be Brandon Knight.He's played in 421 and is still looking for his first playoff outing.MILESTONE COMINGSometime in the next couple of months, the 4,000th playoff game in NBA history will be played.There have been 3,934 postseason contests so far. Based on the way last season went, the milestone game will come late in the conference-semifinal round or early in the conference-final round.FINALS STARTThis season's NBA Finals start May 30. It'll be the earliest Game 1 of the title series since 1986, when Boston and Houston opened their series on May 26.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersNEW YORK — The NBA 2K League, a professional esports league for players of the basketball video game, said on Tuesday that YouTube will stream live broadcasts of all its games this season.The coverage includes the league's more than 230 regular-season, playoff and finals games. Games take place at the league's studio in the New York City borough of Queens.The agreement allows YouTube, a unit of Alphabet Inc, to broaden its already huge array of esports content.It comes at a time of exploding interest in esports, when professional video game players compete against each other, often for prize pools before thousands of fans watching online and in arenas.The NBA 2K League is "one of the very few leagues that we were not streaming on YouTube already," Ryan Wyatt, YouTube's global head of gaming, told Reuters.The platform already distributes content from more than two dozen other leagues. It said it has 200 million users who watch gaming content every day globally. In 2018, users watched more than 50 billion hours of gaming content.YouTube's overall gaming strategy is to bring scores of esports leagues and organizations onto its platform in non-exclusive distribution agreements.Wyatt wants to see esports "on as many platforms as possible, because it's an opportunity... for this space to continue to grow," he said. "We have no desire for exclusivity right now. We want to celebrate the category and grow it."The 21-team NBA 2K League's second season began April 2 and concludes in August. The NBA itself was the first professional sports league to partner with YouTube in 2005, when it launched its own channel.The NBA and YouTube would not disclose financial terms of the agreement. The deal does not currently have an end date because it is "more about just getting them ramped up on our platform," Wyatt said.Fans can also still continue to watch live NBA 2K games on Twitch, a unit of Amazon.com Inc, which previously had the exclusive rights to air the league's games.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMIAMI — The last spot in the NBA playoffs went to the Detroit Pistons.Their reward: A series against MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Milwaukee Bucks.The drama of the regular season went all the way to the very end of the regular season, with seven of the eight first-round playoff matchups not being clinched until the final night was in the books — the last three of them, out West, going down to literally the final moments.The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors will start their quest for a fourth title in five years against the Los Angeles Clippers."It's not going to be as easy as people think it is," Warriors star Kevin Durant said.That's the beauty of the playoffs. It's not supposed to be easy.First-round games in all eight series will be played starting Saturday and Sunday. The second round cannot begin until April 27 at the earliest, the conference finals couldn't start before May 12 and the NBA Finals will start on May 30.EASTERN CONFERENCEThe only matchup in the NBA that was set before Wednesday night was No. 4 Boston against No. 5 Indiana.Everything else, just like all the West matchups, fell into place during Game 82s on Wednesday.The Bucks, the NBA's top overall seed, play the Pistons. No. 2 Toronto draws No. 7 Orlando, with the Magic in the postseason for the first time since 2012. And No. 3 Philadelphia — a team wrapped in intrigue right now — will face No. 6 Brooklyn.Joel Embiid played in only 10 of the 76ers' 24 games since the All-Star break, and general manager Elton Brand told reporters Wednesday that "it is possible" the team's best scorer and rebounder won't be ready to start the playoffs.Embiid isn't the only injury situation that made headlines Wednesday: The Celtics announced that Marcus Smart will miss four to six weeks with an injury to his left oblique — a massive blow to Boston.WESTERN CONFERENCEPortland rallied from 28 points down on Wednesday against Sacramento — which blew a lead that large for the second time this season.Denver finished on a 15-0 run to beat Minnesota.And with that, the West bracket was shaken up one last time before it was finally set.Top-seeded Golden State will face the eighth-seeded Clippers, a matchup that was known after early results Wednesday. The rest went right down to the wire, with No. 2 Denver facing No. 7 San Antonio, No. 3 Portland getting No. 6 Oklahoma City and No. 4 Houston facing No. 5 Utah. It was a worst-case for Houston, which entered the season's final night in place to finish second, third or fourth in the West.The way the results fell means the Rockets, if they get past the Jazz, would likely see the Warriors in the second round — and not in the Western Conference finals. So there will be no rematch of last year's title series out West, a tussle where the Rockets had a 3-2 series lead before Chris Paul's hamstring balked and the Warriors went on to advance and reach the NBA Finals.The Nuggets clinched the No. 2 seed with their big rally to top the Timberwolves. The Blazers got to the No. 3 spot with their wild comeback to beat the Kings. The combination of those results dropped Houston to the No. 4 seed.SATURDAY SCHEDULEAll times EasternBrooklyn at Philadelphia, 2:30 p.m.Orlando at Toronto, 5 p.m.L.A. Clippers at Golden State, 8 p.m.San Antonio at Denver, 10:30 p.m.SUNDAY SCHEDULEAll times EasternIndiana at Boston, 1 p.m.Oklahoma City at Portland, 3:30 p.m.Detroit at Milwaukee, 7 p.m.Utah at Houston, 9:30 p.m.SCORING MARKNBA teams averaged 111.2 points this season, the 11th-highest mark in league history.It's also the highest scoring clip in the league since 1970-71.Records were set for 3-pointers made and attempted for the seventh straight season, along with total points for the fifth time in the last six years. NBA teams scored 273,573 points this season, fueled by new rules that allowed offenses more freedom of movement, a league-wide commitment to playing at a faster pace — and the still-growing love affair with the 3-pointer.In the 2012-13 season, NBA teams averaged 20 attempts from 3-point range — which was a record at that time. This season, they averaged 32 attempted 3s per game.FAREWELLA pair of legends played for the final time Wednesday night — and went out in style.Dwyane Wade had a triple-double for Miami at Brooklyn, 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists. Dirk Nowitzki had 20 points and 10 rebounds for Dallas at San Antonio.The Heat and Mavericks both lost, which was irrelevant to both clubs. The nights were about Wade and Nowitzki, both All-Stars this season.___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — The NBA has rescinded technical fouls called on Golden State's Kevin Durant and JaMychal Green of the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 3 of their first-round playoff series.The players were called for double technicals early in the third quarter Thursday night at Staples Center as they jawed at each other. The Warriors won 132-105 and lead the series 2-1.Both players protested the call, and the league rescinded it Friday.Durant had been ejected from Game 1 with a double technical and he had accumulated three of the seven fouls allotted before the NBA would issue a one-game suspension until the latest tech was withdrawn.Durant said after the game Thursday that he hoped the foul would be rescinded because he doesn't want to jeopardize the two-time defending champions going forward.___Advertisement

James was shut down for several of the Lakers' final games and Paul's Houston Rockets played their final regular-season game Tuesday night. Anthony did not sign with another NBA team after his release from the Chicago Bulls this season after he was traded by the Rockets."Listen, we all started this journey together," James told Fox Sports Southeast. "Obviously CP came into the league a couple years after us, but we have a brotherhood that is just so much more than basketball. CP played last night, we had our last regular-season game last night, and Melo is right here in New York, so we kind of made the plan and made the decision to come up here."The friends often travel together during the summer and picked up the Banana Boat Crew moniker after photos of them riding in one circulated on social media in 2016.James, who won two NBA titles with Wade in Miami, two of the three Wade won altogether, was asked about favorite memories of his friendship with Wade. James said a good answer to that would take a while."I mean, we'd be here all night talking. We'd be here all night talking about the best memories, or the most fond memories I have of D-Wade."The plane rides, the bus rides, the hotels when we get to the city we'd go to the hotel room and just chop it up, the dinners we had on the road, everything we did was always genuine. (There was) always love, and we always wanted the best for one another, no matter the good or the bad."I will say the most founding part was when we lost (to Dallas in 2011). Because, without '11, there's no (2013), no (2012 championship) banners hanging up in (AmericanAirlines Arena). That's what made us. That's what made our team."It's been an unbelievable journey for my guy, and I'm happy to be here for the last little part of the road before the train comes to a stop."--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressTake a look at the five highest-scoring seasons in NBA history.— Wilt Chamberlain scored 4,029 points in 1961-62.— Chamberlain scored 3,586 in 1962-63.— Michael Jordan scored 3,041 points in 1986-87.— Chamberlain scored 3,033 in 1960-61.— Chamberlain scored 2,948 points in 1963-64.There they are. The five best seasons in terms of points that the NBA has ever seen. And those five seasons all have something in common — when they were over, someone not named Chamberlain or Jordan was the MVP.What James Harden did this season for the Houston Rockets was scintillating. He scored 50 or more points nine times. He scored 61 twice. He scored at least 30 points in 32 consecutive games, a stretch that lasted more than two months. He will finish this season with the seventh-highest scoring average in NBA history and win the scoring title by more than 8 points per game — a ridiculous margin.He wins Most Voluminous Points.But maybe not the Most Valuable Player.There are some tremendous individual races in the NBA this season, with a slew of deserving candidates for coach of the year, a rather unexpected two-person race for rookie of the year, and the annual befuddlement about who should win defensive player of the year. The ballot that voters will agonize over most, in some cases, will be the one for MVP.Is it Harden, for the second straight year?Or is it Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo?Compelling cases can be made either way. Harden carried the Rockets and became the most unguardable player in the league. Antetokounmpo took a team that finished seventh in the East last year and lifted it to the No. 1 overall seed in the NBA, continuing his meteoric rise toward total superstardom.Harden is the better scorer, Antetokounmpo the more accurate shooter. Harden is the better ballhandler and passer, Antetokounmpo the better rebounder and defender. Take Antetokounmpo off the Bucks, and they'd be lucky to make the playoffs. Take Harden off the Rockets, and they'd be lucky to make the playoffs.The biggest argument for Harden is the scoring. It has been sensational, without question.But there is precedent, as Chamberlain and Jordan learned. Even a gazillion points doesn't guarantee anyone the Maurice Podoloff Trophy.When these playoffs are over and the trophy is finally handed out in late June, Harden will find out if scoring was enough to win the vote this time.It is tradition in this space to end the regular season by having AP Basketball Writers Brian Mahoney and Tim Reynolds reveal their choices for certain awards and predict what will happen in the playoffs.Their selections:MVPMahoney: Antetokounmpo. Tough to demote Harden when he was even more valuable this season than last, but can't ignore a guy with the Greek Freak's stats on the surprise winningest team in the league.Reynolds: Antetokounmpo. He gets the nod over Harden because the Bucks enjoyed a level of success that few expected, and he's why.MOST IMPROVED PLAYERMahoney: D'Angelo Russell, Brooklyn. Didn't just have a great season. He saved one for a Nets team that was going nowhere.Reynolds: Pascal Siakam, Toronto. The Raptors were 14-3 when he had a double-double, and he more than doubled his scoring average.COACH OF THE YEARMahoney: Mike Budenholzer, Milwaukee. Oversaw improvements across the board to turn a team with playoff aspirations into one with championship aspirations.Reynolds: Doc Rivers, LA Clippers. Hard call over Budenholzer. Steve Kerr, Nick Nurse, Steve Clifford, Michael Malone and Kenny Atkinson also deserving.ROOKIE OF THE YEARMahoney: Luka Doncic, Dallas. Not many players become must-see TV before they even turn 20.Reynolds: Luka Doncic, Dallas. Trae Young came on like gangbusters at the end of the year, but Doncic was better from start to finish.EASTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONMahoney: Milwaukee. The Bucks do so many things well that they can find a way even when things get tougher.Reynolds: Toronto. Milwaukee is built for the long haul and might not be ready — yet. But for the Raptors, if not now, then when?WESTERN CONFERENCE CHAMPIONMahoney: Golden State. Still by far the best combination of talent and experience in the league.Reynolds: Golden State. If healthy, the Warriors are still the one to beat. And they want to send Oracle Arena out the right way.NBA CHAMPIONSMahoney: Warriors in 6.Reynolds: Warriors in 5.BOLD OFFSEASON PREDICTIONMahoney: The July 4 fireworks boom brightest in New York, where Kevin Durant is the centerpiece of a transformed Knicks team.Reynolds: If the Warriors win this title, and they should, expect the core to all come back and try to four-peat. Yes, including Durant.___Brian Mahoney is the AP Basketball Writer based in New York. Tim Reynolds is the AP Basketball Writer based in Miami.___Advertisement

An accumulation of seven technicals during the postseason carries an automatic one-game suspension. He had lobbied for the technicals to be rescinded after Thursday's 132-105 victory.--Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, who missed Game 3 of his team's first-round playoff series against the Brooklyn Nets on Thursday night because of left knee soreness, is listed as doubtful for Game 4 on Saturday. The NBA announced his status in its injury report.Embiid's status has digressed from the first three games when he was listed as questionable. He continues to deal with left knee tendinitis, a problem throughout the regular season, when he missed 14 of the Sixers' 24 games after the All-Star break.Despite Embiid's absence in Game 3, the visiting 76ers rolled to a 131-115 victory over the host Nets to take a 2-1 lead. Greg Monroe started in Embiid's place and collected nine points on 4-for-13 shooting and grabbed 13 rebounds. Game 4 of the best-of-seven will also be played in Brooklyn before the series shifts to Philadelphia on Tuesday.--The status of Detroit Pistons forward Blake Griffin remains uncertain entering Saturday's Game 3 of the team's Eastern Conference first-round series against the Milwaukee Bucks.Griffin missed the first two games with a left knee injury, and coach Dwane Casey didn't shed any light on whether the six-time All-Star will return on Saturday for the eighth-seeded Pistons, who lost the first two games of the series in Milwaukee by an average of 28 points."Day-to-day. I'm not talking about Blake," Casey told reporters after Friday's practice. "Day-to-day. Same old words. Just like I am on coaching -- day-to-day."--Former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue was scheduled to interview with the Los Angeles Lakers for their head coaching vacancy, ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported.The Lakers fired coach Luke Walton last week after three seasons and a 98-148 record.Lue, who previously served as an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics, L.A. Clippers and Cavaliers, became head coach in Cleveland during the 2015-16 season after David Blatt was fired.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

He led the Wildcats in scoring (15.2) and rebounding (7.5) this past season. He also posted nine double-doubles and shot 52.2 percent from the floor, including 42.3 percent from the 3-point line.Washington earned first team All-SEC and third team All-America honors."PJ transformed everything about his game. He became a national player of the year candidate, he showed his full set of his skills and he improved his stock while helping us become one of the best teams in the country," Kentucky coach John Calipari said.Washington is projected to be a mid-first-round pick by ESPN.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — The future of NBA basketball could look like European soccer.Tournaments that take place during the season along with league games intrigue Commissioner Adam Silver as a way to change the format of the NBA's 82-game season.If it even keeps an 82-game season.Silver mentioned everything from shorter games to a shorter season Friday as ways the NBA could make its future product better for players and fans."The format we have in place now — I'm a traditionalist on one hand, but on the other hand it's 50 years old or so, presenting an 82-game season, and there's nothing magical about it," Silver said."I think it's on the league office to always be challenging the way we do things, to be paying attention to changing viewer habits, a changing marketplace, a new world of the way media is presented, often on smaller devices, less on screens, people having shorter attention spans, and saying, 'This is an incredible game, it's never been more exciting, the athleticism has never been greater, fantastic players coming from all around the world, but what's the best way to put the season together?'"Silver has focused on player health as commissioner, opening the regular season earlier to reduce the frequency of back-to-back games, and lengthening the All-Star break.But players are still sitting out games throughout the season — either by their choice or because their teams are requiring it — often for reasons being listed as load management."I think a fair point from fans could be if ultimately the science suggests that 82 games is too many games for these players, maybe you shouldn't have an 82-game season," Silver said. "I accept that, and that's something we'll continue to look at."Fewer games could mean less revenue, unless they could be replaced by something that would generate as many or more viewers. Tournaments could be an answer, even if 82 games remains the format.Silver has pointed to European soccer as something that could bring new interest to the NBA by offering teams more opportunities to win something, instead of just having one champion."That's why I'm particularly interested in looking at different kinds of formats — at midseason tournaments, for example, play-in tournaments — because even accepting that players have so many miles on their bodies, there may be better ways to present it," Silver said. "Assuming guys are going to play 82 games, maybe there should be a certain number of games in the regular season and then there should be two tournaments throughout the season."He acknowledged that model would require a change of thinking in American fans, who are used to only caring about the winner of the NBA Finals.Silver also mentioned the possibility of trimming games from 48 minutes to 40, which is the length of college and international games.He cautioned that none of the changes he discussed after the league's Board of Governors meetings were close to being implemented, and would continue to be studied within the league, perhaps for a few years."Part of it is just the formality that they need to be negotiated with the Players Association, but even if the Players Association came to us and said, 'You guys know best, what is it you want,' I wouldn't know how to answer it," Silver said. "I think it's going to require a lot more research, a lot more thoughtfulness on behalf of the teams, players and the league working together."___Advertisement

He has until May 29 to make up his mind."My whole thing is I want to go into the process with an open mind and understand what I need to improve on and what I need to get better at, while also understanding I have to make the most informed decision possible," Williams said during a press conference. "If it is the right time, then it is the right time. It is just a matter of going into it with the mindset that I'm going into it to improve myself."Williams averaged 18.8 points and 7.5 rebounds this season while earning first-team All-American honors.The Volunteers (31-6) matched the school record for victories and reached the Sweet 16 before losing to Purdue. Williams allows that there is unfinished business."No doubt. There's always that (thought) process of there's more that we can do, more that we can accomplish," Williams said. "That's something that is always going to be in your mind throughout the process no matter what is going on. You have to understand that it's a win-win."If you come back, there's a lot more you can do as a team and individually in the future it can be a win in that aspect as well."Williams' decision to test the NBA waters comes one day after coach Rick Barnes decided to turn down overtures from UCLA to remain at Tennessee."I talked to him three or four times," Williams said of Barnes. "I reached out to him and he reached out to me. I let him know I trusted him because he is a guy who had never been about himself, it has never been about money. It has never been about anything of that sort. It has been about how he can impact people's lives."I know that Coach Barnes, his goal is he wants a championship. In order to make that happen, he knows he can do it here. He knew he could do it wherever he went. I think being here at the University of Tennessee is something that helps him be comfortable."Tennessee point guard Jordan Bone also recently entered the draft. He also is open to returning to the Volunteers.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersHere are the winners and losers even before the opening tip of the 2019 NBA playoffs:BIG WINNER: The NBA.Without LeBron James around anymore, the Eastern Conference playoffs are actually unpredictable. Imagine that. Well, starting with the second round, anyway. When the Boston Celtics passed the Indiana Pacers late in the regular season, it increased the chances of the East's Big Four -- the Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Philadelphia 76ers and Boston -- getting together for some pretty great basketball in early May. And a potential Houston Rockets-Golden State Warriors semi in the West? More must-see TV. Coming soon.BIG LOSER: Dwyane Wade.Gotta say: Tuesday night was an all-timer in the NBA, highlighted by the going-away parties for Wade and Dirk Nowitzki. It was a shame they had to share the national stage, and that's on Wade. If he'd been inspired to put on more dazzling displays like his grand finale and fewer like the lackluster effort in the February home blowout loss to the Detroit Pistons that in the end cost the Heat a playoff spot, we'd be seeing a potential seven-game Wade vs. Giannis extravaganza starting this weekend.SMALL WINNER: Neil Olshey.Did anyone notice that the Portland Trail Blazers actually got better just when their season appeared to blow up when Jusuf Nurkic and CJ McCollum got hurt late in the tightly contested Western playoff battle? Credit Olshey, the Portland general manager who had the foresight to add another big quality man (Enes Kanter) and another scorer (Rodney Hood) before things got desperate. Now it's Kanter vs. Oklahoma City's Steven Adams in a true rarity -- a classic battle of big men -- in a powerful first-round duel of former teammates.SMALL LOSER: Giannis Antetokounmpo.Yes, it could have been Giannis vs. Wade. Or Giannis vs. the entertaining Brooklyn Nets, against whom he had a triple-double and averaged nearly 30 points a game. Even Giannis vs. the Charlotte Hornets' Kemba Walker would have been better than ... Giannis vs. the Pistons. Ugh. The Bucks dominated their Central Division rival this season, sweeping the four-game series, even though Detroit coach Dwane Casey found a way to suck the life out of the MVP candidate, twice holding Giannis to 15 points. Do yourself a favor: When Bucks-Pistons Game 1 comes on television this weekend, switch over to the Masters. Even a replay if need be.LOSERS WHO'LL SOON BE WINNERS: Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving.The curtain closed on the regular season with Anthony Davis getting booed by his home (former) fans, even though he's still under contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. You got LeBron on the sideline and Magic Johnson out of work, and it's all interrelated. And don't think it ends now that the playoffs are here. The over/under is 24: the number of hours between the season-ending loss and the announcement that Durant, Leonard and Irving are out of here. Who will be the first to get the Davis treatment on his way out the door? Somewhere, odds are being posted.--By Dave Del Grande, Field Level MediaAdvertisement

"I was really warm inside after only a few sips. That felt good."Nowitzki holds the record for having played the most seasons for the same club and is sixth in the all-time scorers list of the NBA.Nagging injuries, however, took their toll on his body and continuing his career past the current season was impossible."What I did not want to happen under any circumstance was to say goodbye and be sitting at home, thinking 'damn, you would really like to play now. Why did you do this'," he said."But my body was not good. To be honest my foot where I had surgery last year was not well throughout the year. I knew it would not be getting any better."

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressDURHAM, N.C. — Zion Williamson is leaving Duke after one high-flying season to enter the NBA draft.Widely projected as the top overall pick in the June draft, the AP national player of the year announced his decision Monday.The 6-foot-7, 285-pound Williamson captivated all of college basketball with his freakish, once-in-a-generation athleticism, his energy at both ends of the floor and his omnipresent charisma.The Atlantic Coast Conference player and rookie of the year averaged 22.6 points — tied for the league lead with teammate RJ Barrett — and 8.9 rebounds. Along the way, he became the face of college basketball this season, routinely coming up with at least one highlight-reel play or show-stopping dunk per game.His decision to turn pro came as no surprise. In fact, he spent the season greeting NBA chatter with a playful wink and a knowing nod.He said it would be "dope" to play on a hypothetical New York Knicks team with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Upon learning that LeBron James and Stephen Curry were talking about him during All-Star weekend, he responded that he's "hoping to be there competing against them next year."During his lone college season, he helped the Blue Devils earn the No. 1 ranking in the final AP Top 25 and the top overall seed in the NCAA Tournament. Duke was knocked out by Michigan State in the East Regional final.Now that he's headed to the NBA, one key subplot to follow is which sneaker company will land his endorsement.In one of the signature moments of the season, Williamson blew out his left Nike shoe — the PG 2.5, the signature shoe of Oklahoma City star Paul George — and sprained his right knee in the opening minute of what became a lopsided home loss to rival North Carolina.The impact was immediate — Nike's stock price took a hit the next day, and the shoe company sent a team of representatives to campus to investigate. When Williamson returned roughly three weeks later for the ACC Tournament, he wore a pair of modified size-15 Nikes from the signature line of Irving, a Boston Celtics All-Star and former one-and-done player at Duke.Williamson joins Cam Reddish and Barrett as classmates headed to the pros after one season. Point guard Tre Jones says he will return to school for his sophomore year.___Advertisement

Bickerstaff would return for a second season. Two hours later, that decision had changed, and several other moves were made.The Grizzlies fired Bickerstaff and demoted Wallace to a scouting role.Memphis also named Jason Wexler as team president with "oversight of both business and basketball operations," the team said in a statement. The Grizzlies promoted Zach Kleiman to executive vice president of basketball operations, with former VP John Hollinger reassigned to a senior advisory position."In order to put our team on the path to sustainable success, it was necessary to change our approach to basketball operations," Pera said in a statement. "I look forward to a reenergized front office and fresh approach to Memphis Grizzlies basketball under new leadership, while retaining the identity and values that have distinguished our team."--Sacramento Kings coach Dave Joerger was fired after three seasons, the team announced."After evaluating the season, I determined that we need to move in a different direction in order to take us to the next level," general manager Vlade Divac said.Joerger led the Kings to a 39-43 record this season, good for ninth place in the NBA's Western Conference. It was their best record since 2005-06 -- the last time they qualified for the playoffs. The Kings started this season at 30-26 and were in the playoff hunt until a 9-17 finish left them nine games behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final postseason spot in the West.--Larry Drew will not return for a second season as the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers after he and the team mutually agreed to part ways."Larry and I had a productive discussion about this past season, the future of the franchise and the search process that we will shortly launch regarding the head coaching role," general manager Koby Altman said in a statement. "Larry respectfully declined to participate in the search process and will not be returning to coach the Cavaliers."The Cavs finished 19-63 in 2018-19 as Drew took over after the firing of Tyronn Lue on Oct. 28 following the team's 0-6 start. Drew was named interim head coach at first before agreeing to a new deal on Nov. 5.--Cardiologists have cleared Chicago Bulls forward Lauri Markkanen to resume full basketball activities, the team announced.Markkanen, 21, experienced extreme fatigue and an accelerated heart rate during a game in Toronto on March 26. A battery of tests conducted at Chicago's Rush University Medical Center and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore determined that dehydration and nutrient deficiency caused his symptoms.The 7-footer missed the rest of the regular season, finishing his second campaign with averages of 18.7 points and 9.0 rebounds in 52 games.--The Phoenix Suns officially named James Jones as general manager, giving him control over all basketball operations for the team.The Suns also added Jeff Bower as senior vice president of basketball operations and retained Trevor Bukstein as assistant general manager.

But according to ESPN's Ramona Shelburne on Wednesday, James still stands behind the organization and Lakers owner Jeanie Buss.ESPN also reported that head coach Luke Walton participated in exit meetings with the players on Wednesday. Walton's job security is in jeopardy after the Lakers (37-45) missed the playoffs for the sixth consecutive season despite the offseason signing of James to a four-year, $154 million deal.James, 34, battled injuries and appeared in a career-low 55 games and averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 assists per game in 2018-19.--Following his meeting with Walton, James headed to New York, where he, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony watched Dwyane Wade play his final NBA game. The Miami Heat closed out the season against the Brooklyn Nets.After a pregame video tribute to Wade, the retiring superstar went over and hugged each of his three friends. The four have been friends for years, their bond immortalized by a photo of James, Wade and Paul riding a banana boat together while on vacation in 2015. Anthony was not in the picture but was also on vacation with the group.--Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart has a torn left oblique and could miss the first two rounds of the Eastern Conference playoffs, according to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.Smart averaged 8.9 points, 4.0 assists and 2.9 rebounds this season for the Celtics, who will be the fourth seed in the East after posting a 49-33 regular-season record. Boston will open at home this weekend against the fifth-seeded Indiana Pacers. The physical guard is noted as one of the NBA's top defenders.Smart sustained the injury in a game against the Orlando Magic on Sunday, and he did not play in Tuesday's regular-season finale at Washington.--Anthony Davis acknowledged that despite his desire to leave New Orleans, he could begin the 2019-20 season with the Pelicans."I'm under contract still," Davis said during an informal season-ending news conference. "I have a year left. Obviously it's a possibility it could happen. I don't have ill will toward anybody. I know that it's a possibility that next year I could be here as well. So I can't be mad if I'm here next year."Davis said his next step will be to see who emerges as the general manager for the Pelicans. Dell Demps was fired in February after his handling of the Davis situation, and Danny Ferry is the interim general manager.--The Phoenix Suns have hired longtime NBA general manager Jeff Bower as their vice president of operations, Wojnarowski reported.Bower, 57, was general manager of the then-New Orleans Hornets from October 2005 to July 2010, and he also served as the team's head coach for most of the 2009-10 season after the firing of Byron Scott.The Suns have been without a general manager since Ryan McDonough was fired a week before the start of the 2018-19 season.--The Minnesota Timberwolves plan to offer interim coach Ryan Saunders a multiyear deal as early as this week, league sources told ESPN.Saunders, 32, is the youngest head coach in the league. He took over when Tom Thibodeau was fired in early January and has earned the endorsement of his players, most notably from All-Star center Karl-Anthony Towns.The Timberwolves were 36-45 entering Wednesday night's season finale at Denver, including a 17-24 mark under Saunders' leadership. Saunders reportedly will receive a three-year deal with a team option on the final season.--The Timberwolves also announced that guard Jeff Teague underwent successful debridement surgery Tuesday to clean out his left ankle. The team had no additional updates as to any recovery timetable.Teague played in 42 games for the Minnesota this season, averaging 12.1 points and a career-best 8.2 assists in 30.1 minutes.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMINNEAPOLIS — Jarrett Culver knew Texas Tech desperately needed him to make a big leap after a solid freshman year so he charged full-speed into an offseason determined to refine and expand every element of his game.De'Andre Hunter needed a little longer to do the same at Virginia, even by spending a year as a redshirt watching from the sidelines.Yet here they are in Minneapolis, a pair of players who have blossomed into bonafide NBA prospects for teams a win away from becoming a first-time national champion. Consider it proof — or maybe simply a needed reminder — that college players can still take a slightly longer path to becoming top-tier NBA prospects amid the college game's starry-eyed infatuation with one-and-done talents."You can do that," Culver said Sunday, the day before his Red Raiders meet Hunter's Cavaliers in the national-title game. "The one-and-dones, they're very talented guys coming out of high school and they get looked at a lot. My route was just a little different. I don't know how long I'll be in college. I just know if you put the work in and set your goals, you can do whatever you set your mind to."Look, no one is going to confuse Culver and Hunter for flashier players with tantalizing upside like Duke's Zion Williamson this season or Arizona's Deandre Ayton a year earlier. Yet Culver, a 6-foot-5 sophomore, is the undisputed first (maybe second and third, as well) offensive option with enough versatility to lead the defensively inclined Red Raiders in scoring, rebounding and assists.As for Hunter, the 6-7 redshirt sophomore has developed into a more assertive scorer with 3-point range. Yet it's his defensive versatility that stands out with his ability to defend inside or out — he even checked talented North Carolina freshman point guard Coby White late in a February road win — as the Division I defensive player of the year for the National Association of Basketball Coaches.Check any mock draft, and their names are easy to find. Both are frequently listed among the top 10 picks if they entered the NBA draft after the season ends. And it's likely they'll be matched up against each other at least during some during Monday night's championship game."They'll both be (high) if they both come out, but this is not a great year for the draft," ESPN analyst Jay Bilas said. "You've obviously got the super talent in the top five, the top four. But who knows where they'd go in another year? I think they're first-round talents in most any year."That's what's going to cause a number of players to come out this year: they want to go higher, they would go higher this year than perhaps in another one. Not these two, these two are legit."That's not to say either has been flawless in the NCAA Tournament.Culver averaged 21.5 points through the four-game push through the West Region, but was quiet nearly all Saturday night before scoring seven of his 10 points in the final three minutes to help Texas Tech hold off Michigan State's rally.As for Hunter, he had a rough two-game set in the regionals by making just 8 of 23 shots (34.7 followed by an ineffective first half in Saturday's first national semifinal against Auburn before playing far more assertively after the break."I think he's hard on himself," Virginia coach Tony Bennett said. "If he's missing shots or not helping his team, he puts a lot on himself. We talked about it: 'Be free, man. Go after this. We need you.'"Consider it the next phase of Hunter's growth as a player."I just try to live up to my my own expectations," Hunter said. "I know how hard I work, I know the things I do every day. It gets kind of frustrating at times but I just try to get back to doing what I do and playing the game free."When asked, both players point to the other's ability to affect the game at both ends of the court. Their descriptions could have easily applied to themselves.Fitting, considering they've taken a similar route to what they hope is a net-cutting finish on the way to the NBA."What it says is that players mature at different rates," Bilas said. "Some players are ready when they're freshmen, there are some players that stay in school four years because they want to, some stay three because they want to. There's no one set path to anything, including basketball."______Advertisement

It was his second-highest scoring game of the season. But it was a bittersweet night for the Heat, who were eliminated from playoff contention earlier in the evening when the Detroit Pistons rallied from a 22-point deficit to defeat the Memphis Grizzlies.Philadelphia, which has already clinched the third seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, rested two of its stars: Joel Embiid, who was listed as having a knee injury, and JJ Redick (back).Warriors 112, Pelicans 103DeMarcus Cousins had 21 points and 12 rebounds against his former team as visiting Golden State defeated New Orleans.After clinching home-court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs on Sunday, the Warriors had Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala and Andrew Bogut among their inactive players. Stephen Curry left for game after scoring five points in nine minutes in what the Warriors called "a precaution" after he sustained a mild foot sprain.Jahlil Okafor scored 30 points to lead the short-handed Pelicans, who dressed just eight players and finished the season 33-49.Raptors 120, Timberwolves 100Kawhi Leonard scored 20 points as visiting Toronto completed its regular-season schedule with a victory over Minnesota.The Raptors (58-24) secured the second-best record in the Eastern Conference with the win, behind only the Milwaukee Bucks (60-21), who play their final game Wednesday.Fred VanVleet added 16 points for the Raptors, Chris Boucher added career bests with 15 points and 13 rebounds, and Pascal Siakam and Norman Powell each scored 10 points. Gorgui Dieng and Andrew Wiggins each scored 16 points for the Timberwolves.Jazz 118, Nuggets 108Donovan Mitchell matched his career best of 46 points, and Utah posted a victory over Denver in Salt Lake City.Rudy Gobert added 20 points and 10 rebounds as Utah notched its ninth straight home win against Denver. Utah locked up the No. 5 seed for the Western Conference playoffs.Malik Beasley scored 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting for the Nuggets, who have lost four of their past six games and are a half-game ahead of Houston after the Rockets fell to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday.Trail Blazers 104, Lakers 101Instead of quietly sneaking into the offseason after losing its season finale to playoff-bound Portland, Los Angeles made some noise when Magic Johnson announced his resignation as president of basketball operations for the team.The game still meant something for Portland, though, and the Trail Blazers clinched home-court advantage in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs when Maurice Harkless made a 3-pointer at the buzzer for a win. The Trail Blazers can overtake the Rockets on a tiebreaker to finish third in the West with a win against the visiting Sacramento Kings on Wednesday.Harkless, who left the previous game with left hip tightness, finished with 26 points. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 32 points and eight assists for the Lakers, who finished with 37 wins -- two more than last season.Thunder 112, Rockets 111Russell Westbrook scored 29 points, but it was Paul George's corner 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left that sent Oklahoma City to a home win over Houston.Oklahoma City trailed by 14 early in the fourth quarter and by four in the final minute before Westbrook's and George's heroics.James Harden made his first 12 free throws in the game but with less than 10 seconds left and Houston on top 111-109, he missed one, giving the Thunder a chance to tie or take the lead. Westbrook barreled up the court, briefly handing the ball off to Steven Adams near midcourt before getting the ball and firing it to George in the corner for what proved to be the game-winner.Celtics 116, Wizards 100Terry Rozier led seven Boston players in double figures with 21 points as his team closed out the regular season with a win over host Washington.The Celtics rallied from a 13-point, third-quarter deficit for their sixth win in eight games. Boston, which played without Marcus Smart, Jayson Tatum, Kyrie Irving, Al Horford, Marcus Morris, Aron Baynes and Gordon Hayward, will be the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.Semi Ojeleye, Brad Wanamaker and RJ Hunter had 17 points apiece for Boston, which outscored Washington 27-15 in the fourth quarter. Tomas Satoransky led the Wizards with 19 points, and Bradley Beal scored 16 points in 16 minutes. Beal became the first person in franchise history to finish a season averaging at least 25 points, five rebounds and five assists per game.Pistons 100, Grizzlies 93Andre Drummond scored 20 points and grabbed 17 rebounds, and Detroit came back from a 22-point deficit to defeat visiting Memphis.Despite winning, the Pistons were unable to clinch the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Charlotte Hornets beat the Cleveland Cavaliers and remain one game behind Detroit heading into Wednesday night's final regular-season games. The Pistons finish against the Knicks at New York while the Hornets host the Orlando Magic.The Pistons, who trailed by 22 in the second quarter, climbed all the way back and took an 85-83 lead on Ish Smith's jumper just moments after his 3-pointer tied the score at 83-all. Smith finished with 22 points off the bench, and Luke Kennard added 15 for Detroit.Hornets 124, Cavaliers 97Kemba Walker and Jeremy Lamb scored 23 points apiece, and Charlotte kept its playoff hopes alive with a victory over host Cleveland.The Hornets led by 12 points in the first half and then pushed the lead all the way to 27 in the fourth quarter, winning their fourth straight and eighth in their past 11 games. They hit a season-high 22 3-pointers on 44 attempts and shot 57.7 percent from the field.Miles Bridges and Dwayne Bacon added 18 points apiece for the Hornets. Frank Kaminsky scored 14 and Devonte Graham had 10. Collin Sexton led the Cavs with 18 points.Knicks 96, Bulls 86Dennis Smith Jr. scored 25 points and Kevin Knox and Luke Kornet each notched double-doubles to lead New York past host Chicago.Knox had 17 points and 10 rebounds, Kornet chipped in 12 points and 13 rebounds and Damyean Dotson added 12 points for the Knicks (17-64), who are already assured of the NBA's worst record this season. They can do no worse than tie the franchise record for fewest wins in a regular season, set in 2014-15.The Bulls closed the home portion of their schedule with a 9-32 record, setting a franchise record for home futility. The 2000-01 team held the previous club standard for fewest home victories with 10.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

If his draft stock is not as high as he had hoped, he said he will return to the Kentucky program."If the evaluations tell me I need to elevate my game further, I would be thrilled to return to Kentucky and help this team compete for a championship," Herro said in a statement. "Whatever happens over the next couple of months, I want to thank (Kentucky fans) for (their) support this season and throughout this process."Herro averaged 14.0 points this past season, second on the Wildcats. He led the team with 60 made 3-pointers, while shooting 93.5 percent from the free throw line, a Kentucky single-season record. He led the Wildcats with 32.6 minutes per game.The 6-foot-5, 195-pounder was a five-star recruit out of Whitnall High School in the Milwaukee area, where he was first team all-state in Wisconsin and averaged 32.9 points per game.Kentucky coach John Calipari offered his support to Herro via a Twitter post Friday."What I'm most proud of is how Tyler became not only an efficient offensive player but an efficient defensive player," Calipari wrote. "He's wired and driven like only a few others I've coached. I've had an absolute ball coaching him. Whatever he decides to do in the end, I will support."--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThere are two very compelling reasons why Orlando has Toronto's attention.Or 31 of them, perhaps.The Raptors lost to the Magic twice this season. And Milwaukee, Toronto and Orlando all were tied for the Eastern Conference's best record over the final 31 games of the season — all going 22-9 down the stretch. So when the Raptors play host to the Magic on Saturday in Game 1 of an Eastern Conference first-round series, Toronto expects a red-hot opponent."They're playing very well," Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. "Very well coached. They've got some metrics that speak volumes about who they are. They don't turn the ball over, they don't give up transition baskets, they don't let you get offensive rebounds. They're very methodical in their offensive execution. ... And they're long, man. They're long and athletic."It's a good squad we're playing."Toronto came into this season with the highest of expectations, especially after getting Kawhi Leonard over the summer. The Raptors delivered in the regular season, managing Leonard's workload — he played only 60 games — while still finishing with the second-best record in the NBA."Nothing matters until now," Raptors guard Kyle Lowry said. "Now — this is what matters."The Magic were no playoff lock. They looked like the season was over at the end of January. But their turnaround has been stellar, and for the first time since 2012, the playoffs are their reward.Magic coach Steve Clifford said he has a simple message to his team: "Play our game.""You don't want to change," Clifford said. "You play well for a certain reason. What you're not going to do is reinvent yourself because it's a playoff game. Play the way we play. Play the way we've played this last 31 games. That's what we need to do."The Raptors won't be at full strength for Game 1, and probably won't be for a while.Key reserve OG Anunoby had an emergency appendectomy Thursday night in Toronto, after being diagnosed with acute appendicitis. There's no timetable for his return — and the Raptors are still without Patrick McCaw, who's sidelined with a thumb injury.But Leonard is full-go, and feeling good as well."We did a good job," Leonard said of the season-long load-management plan for him. "Nothing flared up or got worse. The way I'm feeling today, I feel like we did a great job."Magic center Nikola Vucevic said he has sensed a real change in his team over the final 31 games."We're more mature, in a way," Vucevic said. "We just understand what it takes to win."Here's some other things to know going into Game 1:EXPERIENCE MATTERSToronto's likely starting five of Marc Gasol (59), Pascal Siakam (12), Kawhi Leonard (87), Danny Green (100) and Kyle Lowry (62) have a combined 320 games of playoff experience. Orlando's projected lineup of Jonathan Isaac (0), Aaron Gordon (0), Nikola Vucevic (1), Evan Fournier (28) and D.J. Augustin (4) have a combined 33 postseason appearances.CONSISTENT RAPTORSToronto seems to be dogged annually for not yet breaking through and winning a title, or even reaching the NBA Finals. But 27 other teams would happily change places with the Raptors, at least in recent years. Toronto is one of only three franchises with a playoff series win in each of the last three seasons — with Cleveland and Golden State the others.HEAD TO HEADToronto and Orlando split four games this season, each going 1-1 at home. Orlando handed Toronto the biggest loss of its season, a 116-87 defeat on Dec. 28 — a game that was notable for two reasons. Nikola Vucevic had a monster 30-point, 20-rebound game and the Raptors (who went into that night with the NBA's best record) gave Kyle Lowry the night off to deal with back pain.CLIFF WINSThe Magic have had six winning seasons in the last 16 years. Clifford has been part of all six — he was an assistant on five straight winning teams under Stan Van Gundy from 2007-12, and Orlando went 42-40 this season in his return to the organization. The Magic have won 11 series in franchise history and Clifford was on the staff for six of those victories.GORDON WATCHOrlando's Aaron Gordon is about to get his first taste of playoff basketball, and he's hoping for a breakthrough against Toronto. Gordon — a 16.7 point-per-game scorer over the last two seasons — has played against the Raptors 17 times and has never scored more than 16 points in any of those games. He's shooting 38 percent in his career against Toronto.___Associated Press Writer Ian Harrison in Toronto contributed to this story.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressINDEPENDENCE, Ohio — The Cavaliers aren't chasing a championship this spring. They're pursuing a coach.This time, methodically.No longer NBA title contenders, Cleveland is in the initial stages of an expansive, open-minded search general manager Koby Altman hopes will lead to finding the right coach for his young team, which is coming off a 63-loss season."We have to preach patience and we have to continue to grow this thing and we have to find a leader that's obsessed with that process of growing," Altman said Friday while outlining the type of candidates he'll interview. "We're tasked with doing that. We're excited about the next steps. We're done in April for the first time in four years, so we have a lot of time."At this time a year ago, the Cavs were preparing to make another deep playoff run. They made the Finals for the fourth straight year, but fell short in June against Golden State and then suffered a more devastating blow when LeBron James left a month later. The team endured severe growing pains this past season, which included a coaching change and countless injuries, but Altman believes better days lie ahead."The future is bright," he said.His task is finding the right coach to lead the Cavs into it.Altman plans to cast a "wide net" in his search for the fifth coach since 2013. He and his staff are paring down a list of potential candidates that will include former head coaches, current assistants — including some on playoff teams — as well as college coaches of both sexes. Head coaching experience is a plus, but not essential, and he's not limiting the search to candidates with whom he has a previous connection.Already, names are beginning to surface, including several assistants who have ties to the Cavs.Denver's Jordi Fernandez, Utah's Alex Jensen, Orlando's Steve Hetzel, Atlanta's Chris Jent, Portland's Nate Tibbetts and Dallas' Jamahl Mosley all spent time working for Cleveland. Altman intimated continuing the Cavs' rebuild with a person already familiar with the organization would be beneficial.Luke Walton could now be on Cleveland's radar after he parted ways with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Altman said he would be "open-minded" when asked about San Antonio's Becky Hammon, the league's first full-time female assistant.The timetable to find a coach? As long as it takes, Altman said."We want to make sure we get this right," he said. "We want to make sure we get to know these candidates really, really well and flush this thing out. Make sure it's the right fit for the front office, for our players, for the fan base. We want availability, grinding and all that kind of stuff. We want to make sure that's the right fit and we're the right fit for them, too."When Altman gets toward the final stages of the process, he said he may consult with Cavs players. Altman said his primary objective is landing a coach dedicated to development."It's important that we find a leader that's in it for the long haul, that really wants to be a part of Cleveland, our city and this team and help us grow every day," he said. "I think we have to be obsessed with this process of getting better and not so much results-driven — and that's the person I need to find."The Cavs finished with the league's second-worst record and are positioned to add a major piece in the draft. Obviously, winning the lottery and getting Duke's Zion Williamson would solve numerous problems. However, choosing first isn't everything, and Altman is confident the Cavs already have enough solid players to attract quality coaching candidates."We are going to draft a high-impact player, regardless of where the Ping-Pong balls land, and all those things together are a big part of us being an attractive destination," he said. "But I will say this: We're not going to sell our job. The person that is right for this job is going to really, really want to be here. That's going to be the person we hire."Altman again praised Larry Drew, who took over in October and kept the Cavs competitive until the end. Drew isn't part of the future, but Altman said he left a lasting imprint."The great thing that I can be proud of this year is our attitude," Altman said. "We had a great attitude. It wasn't heavy. It wasn't dark, even through all the losses. We had great attitude, great work ethic, and so I think we can build on that."___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressPascal Siakam confidently launches shots he may not have dared attempt in previous seasons. He makes plays during times of the game when he would have been sitting on the bench.The Toronto Raptors forward might be the leading candidate for the most improved player award and he'd like to win it. But he's already received recognition that means more to him.Fellow players have noticed how much work he's put in and how much it has paid off this season. The acknowledgement from All-Stars such as Paul George and Bradley Beal shows that Siakam's giant leap has caught the attention of more than just the media panel that votes for the NBA awards."I just enjoy sometimes after the games, guys coming up to me and showing respect for me. That's the most important thing," Siakam said. "Like, I don't care about the rest. I think when your peers respect your game and respect the fact that they've seen you work, I think that's more important."There's a lot for them to have noticed, including:— Siakam's scoring. It is up from 6.0 points per game through his first two seasons to 17.0 this season.— His 3-point shooting. That's jumped from 21.6 percent to 36.8 percent.A player who was feared almost entirely for his work around the basket now has to be accounted for even when he's away from it. Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson called Siakam an X-factor who now demands a much bigger part of the scouting report."It changes because he's shooting the ball better," Atkinson said. "I think at first you could ignore his shot. Now it's like you've got to respect him from 3 and I know he's worked on it extremely hard, so that changes it."You could be in the paint, wait for his drives. You still have to respect (that) but I think he keeps getting better and better."D'Angelo Russell, Atkinson's All-Star point guard, might be the other top candidate for most improved player after leading the Nets to a surprising playoff berth. Sacramento's De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, Denver's Malik Beasley and the Clippers' Montrezl Harrell are some other players worthy of consideration.But of them, Siakam has the biggest role on the team with the best chance to be playing into June.The Raptors made major changes after they were swept out of the postseason by LeBron James and Cleveland in consecutive years. Dwane Casey was fired even after winning coach of the year honors, and All-Star DeMar DeRozan was dealt to San Antonio in the trade to bring in Kawhi Leonard.The Raptors have come back with 57 wins and the second-best record in the East, with Siakam's growth central to their success. He can play in a traditional big lineup alongside Leonard and center Marc Gasol, or in a smaller one if they go with Serge Ibaka in the middle.The athleticism was always there for the 6-foot-9 forward. But now it's only part of the package for a player who made one 3-pointer his entire rookie season in 2016-17 and now averages one per game, the easiest place to notice his improvement."I don't know who else is even really up for it, who the voting's between, all that stuff. I know that if anybody's done more than this kid, has improved more, has impacted the team more and continued to improve from even geez, 20 games ago," Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. "He just keeps taking another step forward, there has been no steps back."He's certainly deserving. If there's somebody else who is deserving, then sometimes that's the way it works. But he's had an unbelievable season."Soon it will be time for the Raptors to show how much they've improved along with him. They became postseason punching bags the last couple years who want to show they won't be pushed around any longer."We have a new group so it's going to be definitely tough and I think we're more focused on that," Siakam said. "Obviously we think about the playoffs, we're excited about it, can't wait for it. We just want to make sure we get the right chemistry and everything going so when that time comes, we'll be ready to perform."He got into only two playoff games two years ago, when the native of Cameroon was still learning the game. It was only five years earlier when he had come through the Basketball Without Borders camp in Africa, then headed to Texas for prep school and onto New Mexico State before becoming a late first-round pick.He's not sure if friends back home are aware of his success. But if he wins the Most Improved Player award, chances are they'll hear about it."I'm definitely not a personal-type guy where I care about personal accolades and stuff, but definitely a team-guy first," Siakam said. "Something like that, in terms of who I am and the person that I've become, and people that know my story and how I came up, that would mean a lot just because that's me. Like, that's literally who I am as a player and as a person."______Advertisement

The Warriors' first-round opponent, which will be the eighth seed in the West, has yet to be determined. The playoffs begin next Saturday.The Clippers' third straight loss dropped them to 47-34 and closer to a first-round matchup with the Warriors. The Clippers are battling Oklahoma City (47-33) and San Antonio (47-34), both of which won Sunday, for the sixth, seventh and eighth playoff spots in the West.Curry finished with a game-high 27 points for the Warriors, who improved their all-time regular-season record at Oracle Arena to 1,166-770. Like the Warriors, all five Clippers starters scored in double figures, led by Landry Shamet with 17. All but two of Shamet's points came on 5-for-6 3-point shooting.Trail Blazers 115, Nuggets 108Damian Lillard scored 30 points, and Al-Farouq Aminu added a season-high 23 points and 11 rebounds as Portland rallied for a victory over visiting Denver.The Trail Blazers closed the game on a 17-3 run to register their ninth win in the last 11 games. CJ McCollum made his return to the Portland lineup after missing 10 games with a knee injury. McCollum collected nine points, six rebounds and six assists in 25 minutes.Gary Harris scored 18 points to lead Denver, which won the season series with Portland 3-1. The Nuggets played without center Nikola Jokic, forward Paul Millsap and guard Jamal Murray, all given the night off for rest.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMINNEAPOLIS — The longest active streak of missing the NBA playoffs belongs to Sacramento, where general manager Vlade Divac has been trying to return the Kings to the league's elite over the last four seasons.Back when the slick-passing Serbian big man was in the paint, the Kings had quite the run. For his impact on the NBA as one of the pioneering Eastern Europeans, Divac was announced Saturday as one of the 12 honorees in the 2019 class of the Basketball Hall of Fame."We created something special there, the first day of training camp that led us," said Divac, who played for Sacramento from 1998-2004, with a peak in 2002 when the Kings lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in overtime of Game 7 of the Western Conference finals. "For six years, we were the most exciting team in the league and really played basketball the right way."The class will be enshrined at the Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Sept. 6. Selected this year with Divac were NBA players Carl Braun, Chuck Cooper, Bobby Jones, Sidney Moncrief, Jack Sikma and Paul Westphal, NBA coach Bill Fitch, NBA contributor Al Attles, WNBA player Teresa Weatherspoon, the 1957-59 teams from Tennessee A&I and the Wayland Baptist University program.Divac, who was elected directly by the international committee, played 16 years in the NBA, including eight with the Lakers. The 7-foot-1 Divac had his jersey retired by the Kings after helping them start a streak of eight straight postseason appearances upon his arrival. They never advanced past the conference finals, a surge that coincided with the Lakers dynasty of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.One of Divac's fellow starters on those Kings teams was Chris Webber, who wasn't included in the class. Now an analyst for CBS Sports, Webber quickly sent Divac a congratulatory message after the announcement in Minneapolis at the Final Four."For the last five or six days when I found out I was going to be there, I was only hoping that he was going to be next me," Divac said. "I'm sure it's going to happen down the road, but it would be awesome if he was right next to me."Moncrief and Sikma, who were elected by the North American committee, were teammates with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1986-89. The seven-time All-Star Sikma, who won an NBA title in his second season with the Seattle SuperSonics, set a record with the Bucks in 1988 as the only center in history to lead the league in free-throw percentage at 92.2. Sikma is now a consultant with the Toronto Raptors, who are in second place in the Eastern Conference behind the resurgent Bucks."My hope is we get in the conference finals and we're facing the Bucks, and then I'll kind of keep my thoughts to myself a little bit," Sikma said, smiling.Moncrief was a five-time All-Star and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year in the mid-1980s for the Bucks, who lost in the Eastern Conference finals three times during his career. Moncrief also reached the Final Four in his final season at Arkansas, 1978-79, under coach Eddie Sutton, for whom he gave credit for instilling in him the fundamentals that carried him to professional success."You'd take a four-hour practice: three hours on defense. Seriously," Moncrief said. "And they wonder why I couldn't shoot when I got to the NBA! I didn't shoot. I just played defense."Weatherspoon, who was elected by the women's committee, was a five-time WNBA All-Star for the New York Liberty who was the first in the league to reach 1,000 points and 1,000 assists. She led Louisiana Tech to an NCAA championship in 1988.Jones and Westphal were the other players elected by the North American committee. Jones was an eight-time NBA All-Defensive first team pick and four-time All-Star with the Philadelphia 76ers, winning a title with them in 1983.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — Dwyane Wade was hurting, sitting on the training table trying to get enough treatment to get him on the floor one last time.A couple of hours later, he looked like a guy capable of playing well beyond the final night of his career.Wade had 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in his last NBA game, which the Brooklyn Nets won by beating the Miami Heat 113-94 on Wednesday night to finish 42-40 and clinch the No. 6 seed in the Eastern Conference.With close friends LeBron James, Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony leading the cheers from their courtside seats, Wade had his fifth career triple-double in three quarters. He fittingly secured it with a pass to Udonis Haslem, his teammate of 15 years who plays sparingly now and made his only start of the season."I was like, I don't know why, but everybody feels like now you've got to go out and score 60 in your last game because Kobe did it," said Wade, wearing a sparkling gold jacket and gold sneakers. "So hopefully I took the bar all the way back down and say let's go get a triple-double, that's easier."A night after scoring 30 points in his final game in Miami, Wade showed one more time that he's walking away with his skills intact.He played 36 minutes, dribbling out the shot clock the final time he had the ball before checking out with 10 seconds remaining. Then it was time for a lengthy postgame celebration on the court with teammates and friends."The man went out with a triple-double. Don't let that go unnoticed. He had a triple-double," All-Star D'Angelo Russell said. "He is a guy that paved the way for a lot of us. He's been with that franchise for that long period of time. He's Mr. Miami."Russell had 21 points on seven 3-pointers for the Nets, who will face the third-seeded Philadelphia 76ers beginning this weekend in their first postseason appearance since 2015, one that seemed unlikely when they were 8-18 in December. But they went 34-22 from there for their first winning record since going 44-38 in 2013-14 — when they were knocked out by Wade's Heat in the second round."Special night," Nets coach Kenny Atkinson said. "Pretty amazing season so far."The game mattered only to the Nets, who quickly ended any fears of finishing seventh and having to face the Toronto Raptors in the first round.But that was secondary to a last chance to celebrate Wade, the three-time NBA champion who was ending his 16th and final NBA season.He was loudly cheered from the moment he emerged alone from the tunnel for pregame layups. Fans — egged on at one point by Paul and Anthony — chanted "We want Wade! We want Wade!" when he was on the bench, even though the 37-year-old guard had played a season-high 35 minutes Tuesday and coach Erik Spoelstra warned before the game that it probably wouldn't be that way again.But there was no keeping Wade down for long. It took him a little bit to get going, as Jarrett Allen added Wade to the list of stars whose shots he's blocked this season — a list that included James."I loved seeing CP and Melo over there getting the crowd going to get Dwyane back in there and Dwyane comes from the old-school NBA," Spoelstra said. "That was pre-load management, so we were not load managing him tonight and I was not talking to my sports scientist whether he could go, even though I walked in and saw him on that training table an hour before the game and he did not look fit to go, at all. But he's cut from a different cloth."The Heat hoped the final game would matter, but the Nets and Orlando Magic had clinched spots over the weekend to leave only one spot left coming into the last week. Miami was eliminated from contention for it despite its victory Tuesday."For me, I'm happy with this season," Wade said. "Unfortunately for our organization and our team, we weren't able to put ourselves in a position to win enough games to be in the playoffs, but for what I wanted for this season, I'm happy to say that I completed that."TIP-INSHeat: Haslem finished with 12 points and 11 rebounds. ... Wade passed Elgin Baylor (23,149 points) to move into 29th place on the NBA's career list.

Anthony, who helped persuade Wade to return this season, didn't play long this season before parting ways with Houston.

We will not extend him a qualifying offer for the 2019-20 season," the NBA team said in a statement.The Eagles said in their statement they are "aware of the situation" and "continuing to gather more information." They said they will not comment further now.Mills started eight games for the Eagles last season before going on injured reserve in December after hurting a foot.Philadelphia drafted him out of LSU in the seventh round in 2016. He was a member of the Eagles' Super Bowl championship team after the 2017 season, when he started 15 of 16 regular-season games.Robinson appeared in seven of the Wizards' 82 games last season and also played for their NBA G League affiliate, the Capital City Go-Go.______Advertisement

"He's the most improved basketball player in the NBA this year and he's only going to get better."Siakam was 13 for 20 from the floor and the Raptors held Orlando to 36% shooting."It's just taking what a defense gives us and going with it," Siakam said.Kawhi Leonard — battling illness this week — had 16 points and 10 rebounds. Danny Green had 13 points and Lowry finished with 12 points and 10 assists, plus ran down a huge offensive rebound with about 15 seconds left to extend a critical possession and spoil Orlando's first home playoff game since 2012."It was really what I thought it was going to be tonight," Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. "I really thought this was going to be a tough atmosphere to play in."Terrence Ross led Orlando with 24 points, and Nikola Vucevic shook off a slow start to finish with 22 points and 14 rebounds.Game 4 is Sunday night in Orlando."Our turnovers hurt us again," Vucevic said, lamenting Orlando's 16 giveaways. "We had too many of those. Empty possessions for us and against a team like that you can't have that."The Raptors trailed 61-60 midway through the third after a brief Orlando spurt, then went on a 16-0 run over the next four minutes to take the lead for good. Siakam and Green were both 3 for 3 during the run, the Magic missed 10 consecutive shots over a span of 6 1/2 minutes and had to play uphill the rest of the way.That being said, they went down swinging.Lowry's 3-pointer with 7:48 left gave Toronto its biggest lead at 86-69. The Magic came flying back, and Ross' 3-pointer with 41 seconds left got Orlando to 96-93.Leonard was short with a jumper on the next possession — but the Magic couldn't control the rebound, Lowry ran it down and Leonard made a pair of free throws with 12.9 seconds remaining to clinch the win."Critical," Magic coach Steve Clifford said.Orlando, which finished the regular season by winning 13 of its final 14 home games, was 13 of 44 from 3-point range.Toronto scored the first 10 points — the last five by Siakam, who was a problem from the outset for the Magic — and led by as many as 11 in the first half. The Magic got within 48-45 at the break after Ross beat the clock from midcourt at the buzzer.The Magic got the lead twice in the second half, once by one point, the other by two points. And both leads lasted exactly 15 seconds, getting taken away on 3-pointers by Siakam and Green.And now it's up to Orlando to regroup, the same way Toronto did after dropping Game 1."It's 2-1," Clifford said.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe Milwaukee Bucks had the best record in the NBA this season, so it would be no great surprise to see them playing for the title in June.Of course, for this franchise, advancing at all would be a significant step.The Bucks are an unusual top seed — one that hasn't made it past the first round of the playoffs since 2001. Advancing to round two may be the absolute minimum expectation this time, when Milwaukee starts its postseason journey Sunday night against eighth-seeded Detroit.It's an intriguing series mostly because it will be the first chance to observe how these Bucks handle playoff pressure as title contenders. This is a team that didn't even have home-court advantage in the first round a year ago. Now Milwaukee has it for the whole postseason."We know what's at stake. We know we have to get past the first round. We haven't been yet," Milwaukee's Khris Middleton said. "But at the same time, it's no pressure for us. Just keep doing what we do. Play the way we play, be who we are. We'll be fine."The Bucks improved by 16 victories from last season, winning 60 for the first time since 1980-81. With Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the way, this might be Milwaukee's most formidable outfit since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson were there during the first half of the 1970s — or at least since the Don Nelson-coached teams of the 1980s.The Bucks lost to Boston in seven games last year. They'll do their best to avoid any winner-take-all scenarios against the Pistons, who haven't won a playoff game since 2008. Detroit secured a playoff spot this year by winning at New York on the final night of the regular season. It was a step forward for the Pistons in their first season under coach Dwane Casey, but it's not clear how much more Detroit can expect from Blake Griffin, the man who did more than anyone to lift this team to the postseason.Griffin has been dealing with a troublesome knee, and he missed the all-important game against the Knicks. Even if Griffin is healthy, everyone understands who is expected to win this series."Nobody on this planet that's an NBA fan is going to expect us to win. That's great. That's good," Casey said. "I think a lot of our guys have been underdogs all their lives."Some more things to know before the start of this series:HISTORYThe Pistons swept the Bucks in the second round in 1989 en route to the NBA title. That was the last time Milwaukee won a playoff series until the Ray Allen-led Bucks went to the conference finals in 2001.Detroit also beat the Bucks in the first round in 1976, 2004 and 2006.FAMILIAR FACESThe Pistons acquired 7-foot-1 Thon Maker from Milwaukee in a trade earlier this season. He could be a key player, especially if Griffin is limited."Playing against Thon is going to be the weirdest thing," Antetokounmpo said. "It's going to be fun. I know he's going to come and play hard and do the best for his team. I love that about him."Middleton was drafted by the Pistons in the second round in 2012.STRENGTH AGAINST STRENGTHMilwaukee had the second-best defensive rebounding percentage in the league during the regular season. But the Bucks will be tested by Detroit's Andre Drummond, who led the NBA with 5.4 offensive rebounds per game."They do a very good job of sending all their guys in, from the point to their 5-men are all in the paint to make sure that nobody gets the offensive rebound," Drummond said. "It's going to come down to really just me fighting it out. We don't need our guards coming in. ... They are very good in the open floor when we do miss."HEALTHGriffin's status is the big question heading into this series, but Milwaukee has some injuries too. Nikola Mirotic, who broke his left thumb March 19, could play in Game 1. Tony Snell (sprained ankle) is not likely to be available until the middle of the series.Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon went down with a right foot injury last month.EARLY MEETINGSMilwaukee won all four matchups between these teams in the regular season. Only one of them was decided by single digits.The four games were all between Dec. 5 and Jan. 29.___Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister___Advertisement

That was followed by a rare slam dunk that elicited howls from the crowd and a big smile across Nowitzki's face.The 14-time All-Star and sixth-leading scorer in NBA history then drained another jumper for 26 points and an 80-49 Dallas lead. He re-entered the game with three minutes left and hit two more buckets to go 11 of 31 from the floor. He finished with eight rebounds, three assists and a block in a season-high 32 minutes.Suns veteran Jamal Crawford wasn't going to let Nowitzki totally steal the stage. He put in seven 3-pointers in posting a season-high 51 points -- one off his career best -- with 26 coming in the fourth quarter, to get the Suns as close as 105-100 with 4:20 to play.Crawford, 39, became the oldest player ever to score 50-plus points in an NBA game. The old mark was held by Michael Jordan, who was 38 when he scored 51 for the Washington Wizards on Dec. 29, 2001, against the Charlotte Hornets.According to ESPN, Crawford also became the first player to score 50 points for four different franchises (Chicago Bulls, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors and now Phoenix).The Suns closed out a miserable season, finishing 19-63.A longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery kept Nowitzki out until mid-December. From there, he mostly came off the bench for the first time in his career, and averaged 6.6 points in less than 15 minutes a game before Tuesday.But on this special night, Nowitzki turned back the clock, and so did the crowd as it chanted "M-V-P! M-V-P!" Nowitzki won the league's regular-season MVP award in 2006-07 and earned NBA Finals MVP in 2011, when he delivered Dallas its lone championship.The future of the Mavs (33-48), rookie Luka Doncic, also didn't disappoint, notching his eighth triple-double with 21 points, 11 assists and 16 rebounds. He moved into sole possession of third place for most triple-doubles by a rookie.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

He later said via social media that he had tried to play basketball again before doctors gave him the OK."I'll be declaring for the 2019 NBA Draft," Porter posted on Twitter. "I'd like to sincerely thank everyone who has helped me get to this point in my journey, especially my family, coaches, and teammates. Excited for this next step!"Porter averaged 9.9 points and 6.8 rebounds as a 2017-18 freshman. He was named the co-Sixth Man of the Year in the Southeastern Conference after helping the Tigers reach their first NCAA Tournament in five years.--Missouri State forward Tulio Da Silva declared for the draft but decided not to hire an agent and will keep open the option of returning for his senior season.Da Silva averaged 14.3 points and 7.4 rebounds this season."Tulio plans to go through this process to better evaluate his future and make it possible for him to return for his senior season," Bears coach Dana Ford said in a statement.--Gonzaga guard Zach Norvell Jr. will enter his name in the draft while maintaining the option to return to school for his junior season."Zach has been an absolute joy to coach and a tremendous asset to this program," head coach Mark Few said in a statement. "As with all of our guys that go through this process, we will help provide accurate information to Zach from the correct people to assist him in making the best decision."Norvell averaged 14.9 points, 4.3 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 37 games last season.

He immediately fell and lost control of the ball.The team already was short-handed without key contributors such as Kevin Durant (flu-like symptoms), Klay Thompson (right knee soreness), Andre Iguodala (toe) and Andrew Bogut (rest), yet Golden State beat New Orleans 112-103.Warriors coach Steve Kerr was relatively tight-lipped about the injury after the game -- even labeling it an ankle issue when the team had earlier reported it as a sprained foot -- but Golden State's in-game actions spoke louder than his words.After going to the locker room for an examination, Curry returned to the game briefly, an indication the Warriors don't believe the injury is serious.In fact, it was Curry who waved himself off after hitting a shot, clearly not willing to risk further damage with the playoff opener potentially as close as four days away. He finished with five points in nine minutes of action."We think he's going to be fine. He tweaked it," Kerr told reporters afterward.The coach then was asked if the Warriors' Wednesday duel with the Toronto Raptors for the second-best record in the NBA played any role in Curry re-entering the game."We would like to win every game," Kerr responded. "Whatever happens with the seedings, we prioritize our health."Golden State already had secured the top seed in the Western Conference playoffs.In 2017, Curry also turned his right ankle on the Pelicans' home court. He missed almost a month because of that injury.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

He expressed his affection for Buss, saying, "I knew I couldn't be face-to-face and tell her. I couldn't stand to tell her."He was annoyed by being sanctioned by the NBA for tampering when talking to or about players on other teams.Johnson added about the day-to-day NBA business, "What I didn't like is the backstabbing and the whispering. I don't like a lot of things that went on that didn't have to go on."I hope that after (the season ends), the Lakers can head in the right direction, which we are. Injuries really hurt us, but I enjoyed working with Jeanie."Walton's future is in jeopardy after he failed to lead the Lakers to the postseason in the first season with LeBron James on the team. The Lakers entered the Tuesday night game against the Portland Trail Blazers with a 37-44 record.Walton, 39, is set to wrap up his third consecutive sub-.500 season with Los Angeles. He entered Tuesday with a career record of 98-147 for a .400 winning percentage.Buss has been a strong proponent of Walton but previously said she planned to let Johnson and general manager Rob Pelinka decide his future, according to ESPN.

"I am extremely grateful to the administration, which has supported me and our basketball program on every level."I've been amazed by our coaches, trainers, managers and staff who work relentless hours, which enables this team to grow and thrive. I've been honored to coach the young men who are the heart and soul of this program. It's a job I will always cherish."Mullin's older brother, Rod, died from cancer in early March.Athletic director Mike Cragg issued a statement thanking Mullin."St. John's basketball progressed well during his tenure, culminating with a trip to the NCAA Tournament this past season. Coach Mullin has a deep passion for this program and he has been committed to helping our student-athletes achieve their goals on and off the court, so I know this was not an easy decision. We wish him and his family nothing but the best as he begins this new chapter of his life."Mullin went 59-73 at his alma mater, taking the Red Storm to one NCAA Tournament -- this season's First Four, where they lost to Hurley's Sun Devils. Hurley is "expected to be at the top of St. John's list" of replacements, according to a Sunday report from Jon Rothstein of CBS Sports.Hurley is a New Jersey native and has a background with Cragg, who spent more than 30 years in various administrative roles at Duke, his time intersecting with Hurley's playing days with the Blue Devils from 1989-93.Rick Pitino told the New York Post on Tuesday that he would be interested in the job, but he wants an apology and to be cleared publicly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. Louisville fired Pitino in September 2017, in part because the government alleged Pitino was part of a play-for-pay scandal involving five-star recruit Brian Bowen.Pitino has maintained his innocence. Now coaching in Greece, he denied to the Post that he reached out to St. John's on Monday."I think the AD is a Duke man and Bobby Hurley was a great Duke player, and I think he would be an excellent choice," Pitino said.Hurley is 73-58 in four seasons at Arizona State and 115-78 in six years as a college head coach, including two years at Buffalo.Mullin, a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame member, holds the St. John's record of 2,440 points, set from 1981 to 1985.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressLOS ANGELES — Luke Walton is out as coach of the Los Angeles Lakers after three losing seasons.Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka announced Walton's departure Friday, three days after the abrupt resignation of president of basketball operations Magic Johnson. Pelinka called Walton leaving a mutual decision.The former Lakers forward went 98-148 after getting his first permanent head coaching job with the 16-time NBA champions. The former Golden State assistant never led the Lakers to the playoffs, not even after the arrival of LeBron James last summer.Walton leaves three days after the Lakers' final game of their 37-45 season was upstaged by the shocking pregame resignation of Johnson, who inherited Walton when he took over the Lakers' front office in February 2017. Johnson attributed his decision in part to his desire and reluctance to fire Walton, who is close to Lakers owner Jeanie Buss.A potential power struggle instead ended with both men out of their jobs after this wild week. Pelinka, who was hired along with Johnson, announced the move in a possible sign of the increased organizational power of Kobe Bryant's former agent."I want to thank Jeanie Buss and the Buss family for giving me the opportunity to coach the Lakers," Walton said in a statement issued by the Lakers. "This franchise and the city will always be special to me and my family."Walton joined the Lakers with fanfare in 2016 after his successful tenure alongside coach Steve Kerr with the powerhouse Warriors. Walton stepped in as Golden State's interim coach when Kerr was sidelined by health issues to start the 2015-16 season, and he led the Warriors to a 24-0 start and a 39-4 record before Kerr returned to the bench."They're losing one of the best human beings in the NBA. They're losing a guy who knows the game as well as anybody I've ever met," Kerr said Friday in Oakland. "They're losing somebody who players believe in, players want to play for. But again, he was dependent on circumstances, just like all of us are. I feel for Luke."The Lakers improved their record in each of Walton's three seasons, but never finished higher than third place in the Pacific Division. The current Lakers were the franchise's most successful team since their playoff drought began in 2013, but it wasn't enough to save Walton's job."I think Luke did a hell of a job with what he had, the cards he was dealt," point guard Rajon Rondo said. "The guys fought every night."Los Angeles was in fourth place in the Western Conference at 20-14 after beating Golden State last Christmas, but James and Rondo were injured during the game. The Lakers' season fell apart during the longest injury absence of James' career, and they ended the season with nearly every important player in their young core sidelined by injuries.Walton was tasked with one of the most difficult jobs in the NBA this season. Johnson and Pelinka gave him an oddly constructed roster of idiosyncratic NBA veterans on one-year deals playing alongside James and several talented youngsters including Brandon Ingram, Lonzo Ball, Kyle Kuzma and Josh Hart.Walton's Lakers also were rattled by Johnson's midseason pursuit of disgruntled New Orleans forward Anthony Davis in a trade that would have resulted in a complete roster upheaval. Several Lakers acknowledged the shadowy pursuit's impact on their play."It affected us a lot," guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope said. "Once the trade talk was there, the locker room changed. Everybody was pretty much worried about that, especially guys that haven't been through it. They were worried where they were going to end up."James and the Lakers' players have been uniformly supportive of Walton, who managed to keep his team playing hard and harmoniously under the Los Angeles microscope despite multiple major injuries and distractions. Walton just couldn't coax enough wins out of the Lakers, who ruined their second-half playoff hopes with confounding losses to bottom-dwellers New York and Phoenix."Want to thank Luke and the rest of the coaching staff for allowing me to be me from day 1," Kuzma tweeted. "They say opportunity is everything in the league and they gave me that right from the jump."Not many Lakers observers questioned Walton's man-management abilities, but his tactical acumen was widely criticized. Johnson and many fans had problems with everything from Walton's playing time decisions and curious rotations to his reported reluctance to add new assistants with fresh perspectives to his bench.Despite everything, the Lakers went 15-8 in their 23 games with James, Ingram and Ball all healthy. Buss decided not to find out whether Walton could continue that progress in the fall with renewed health and a high draft pick this summer.The Lakers' next coach will be their sixth since the retirement of Phil Jackson in 2011. Walton's 246 games in charge were the most by any coach in the tumultuous near-decade since the franchise's last championship in 2010.Ex-Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue, the former Lakers guard, already has been frequently mentioned as a potential replacement for Walton due to his obvious ties to James. Philadelphia assistant Monty Williams, the well-regarded former New Orleans head coach, also is expected to be a candidate.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe Golden State Warriors are set to begin their quest for a third straight title, and this time it's up to someone else to try to stop them.With LeBron James gone to the West and this year gone entirely from the postseason, the Eastern Conference headquarters for the NBA Finals won't be in his home for the first time since 2010.He played for the title for eight straight years, which may have been great for the TV ratings but lately wasn't much good for the competition. The Warriors swept Cleveland last year after winning 4-1 in 2017.Teams are lining up to seize his old spot atop the East, all capable of providing the intrigue that was absent the last couple years.There's Milwaukee, with Giannis Antetokounmpo in position to exit June fully atop the NBA with a title and an MVP award.Or Toronto, humiliated by the Cavaliers in the last two years but armed now with a former NBA Finals MVP in Kawhi Leonard.It could be Philadelphia, with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons anchoring perhaps the most talented starting five outside of the Bay Area.And don't forget Boston, the presumptive East favorite in the preseason that can still live up to expectations.The best player is gone, but maybe things will be better."I think the parity and the competition in the East, and not knowing and everyone having a sincere chance maybe in the East that did not, when not you look between Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia," TNT analyst Chris Webber said. "All of those story lines, new young stars that's coming in."The long road to get to the finals begins Saturday with four games, including the top-seeded Warriors against the Los Angeles Clippers in the West. No. 2 Denver faces No. 7 San Antonio in the other West opener, while No. 3 Philadelphia meets No. 6 Brooklyn, and No. 2 Toronto takes on No. 7 Orlando in the East.On Sunday, the overall No. 1 seed Bucks face No. 8 Detroit, and No. 4 Boston hosts No. 5 Indiana in the East. In the West, No. 3 Portland and No. 6 Oklahoma City meet in a matchup of Northwest Division rivals, and No. 4 Houston and No. 5 Utah square off in the opener of a series between two of the strongest teams in the second half of the season.It's the start of postseason that looks different far beyond just the absence of James for the first time since 2005.It includes Denver, in the playoffs for the first time since 2013. Brooklyn is a playoff team for the first time since 2015 and Orlando is back for the first time since 2012.The Warriors, of course, haven't just been going to the postseason every year, but getting all the way to the finals once they do. They've done that four straight years, winning three of them, and with a strong finish after some occasional lapses surged to the best record in the West.Still, this playoff path could provide them plenty of obstacles. The Warriors may need to get by scoring champion James Harden and the Rockets, who took them to a seventh game last year in the conference finals, just to get back to that round this time."It doesn't matter who you play in the playoffs, you're going to get tested. Everybody's good," Golden State coach Steve Kerr said.Get out of the West, and the Warriors may have to then get on a plane. They had home-court advantage in all four finals against Cleveland, but Milwaukee and Toronto both finished with better records and would host Games 1 and 2 if they win the East.And there could be the distractions about their future, with Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson able to become free agents this summer.The Warriors wouldn't be alone when dealing with that. Toronto (Leonard), Philadelphia (Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris) and Boston (Kyrie Irving) all will be trying to win a title with players who could then leave them.But those are issues for July. First, it's all about just getting to June."It's a great feeling," Bucks All-Star Khris Middleton said. "Playoffs don't always come around. I've been a part of that couple years but it's been a great season so far. I know guys been itching to get to this first playoff game."___Advertisement

"It starts with our purpose, which is to expand our audience and grow at a faster rate."We believe we'll do that by becoming more and more culturally relevant over time. It led us to a new target consumer, new design target that's much, much younger — the 16-to-34 millennials, who are very diverse, very socially conscious, engaged in issues of today."The WNBA's 23rd season begins May 24, with the Seattle Storm the defending champion.The league partnered with Sylvain Labs, an innovation and brand design consultancy last year, to learn more about its existing fans and potential new fans. They developed a long-term growth strategy and identify new marketing opportunities."We've engaged very, very closely throughout this process," Hedgpeth said. "Six months working with Sylvain Labs to develop what the new brand will stand for."The two groups, along with player input, came up with the league's new logo."They took the silhouette out of the box which is a massive breakthrough as she was perceived totally different," Hedgpeth said. "She was free, there was more movement there, taking up more space. She's more athletic, longer physique. This is basketball on our terms. That was a phrase that really resonated with the players. That's really symbolic in that regard."The new logo is different from others affiliated with the NBA."The NBA logo, there's a rectangle around him, he's in a box. Same with the G-League logo and the previous W-logo. She had a box around her," Hedgpeth said. "The box is going away. It's powerful, it's freeing and it's expansive."It's the first time the league will have a new logo since 2013. While the new logo won't be on the uniforms or balls until next year because of the lack of production time needed to do it, it will be everywhere else around the league.Hedgpeth insisted that the logo wasn't modeled after one player and that the hair was a huge part of the conversation. The logo has a bun which represents the way many players wear their hair.The league also has a new marquee partner in AT&T."They are a perfect fit," Hedgpeth said. "They have such a great fit to diversity and inclusion and accurately portraying women in advertising."___Advertisement

I'm a little overwhelmed, as you would think," Nowitzki told the sellout crowd after the Mavericks' 120-109 victory over the Phoenix Suns. "As you guys might expect, this is my last home game."Nowitzki made his much-anticipated retirement announcement after delivering a season-high 30-point performance, with five 3-pointers, against the Suns. The 7-footer scored 10 points in the opening seven minutes and had 19 points on a season-high 18 shot attempts in the first half.The 14-time All-Star and sixth-leading scorer in NBA history (31,540 points) finished the game with eight rebounds, three assists and a block in a season-high 33 minutes.The 40-year-old Nowitzki, whose playing career will officially end Wednesday night when the Mavs play the San Antonio Spurs, was honored by the appearance of five of his childhood heroes -- Charles Barkley, Larry Bird, Scottie Pippen, Shawn Kemp and fellow German Detlef Schrempf -- for a postgame ceremony that included heartfelt speeches by Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle and owner Mark Cuban."Amazing that my heroes came out here for this game," Nowitzki said. "Thank you guys so much. Love you guys. Grew up watching you and idolizing you guys so this means more than you will ever know."Mark, can't wait to see what you've got for my jersey retirement. I mean, this is a high bar that you set. But as you guys might expect, this is my last home game."Nowitzki's final season didn't actually begin until mid-December thanks to a longer-than-expected recovery from ankle surgery. From there, he mostly came off the bench for the first time in his career and averaged 6.6 points in fewer than 15 minutes a game.But on this special night, Nowitzki turned back the clock, and so did the crowd as it chanted M-V-P! M-V-P! Nowitzki won the league's regular-season MVP award in 2007 and earned NBA Finals MVP in 2011, when he delivered Dallas its lone championship.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW ORLEANS — The Pelicans have reached an agreement in principle to make former Cleveland Cavaliers general manager David Griffin New Orleans' new executive vice president of basketball operations, three people familiar with the situation said Friday.The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because contract negotiations are ongoing and no announcement has been made.Griffin will take over for former Pelicans general manger Dell Demps, who was fired in the middle of his ninth season with the club — a few weeks after All-Star Anthony Davis' trade request in late January.Griffin's agreement to join New Orleans, which was first reported by ESPN, puts him at the center of the club's effort to find the best deal for Davis. Griffin also could decide the fate of Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who has two years left on his contract.The 45-year-old Griffin was the Cavaliers' GM from 2014 to 2017, during which LeBron James returned from Miami to Cleveland and the Cavs won an NBA title. The highlights of his tenure included a trade that brought star power forward Kevin Love to the Cavs. But Griffin's contract was not renewed after the 2016-17 season and James joined the Los Angele Lakers in free agency a year later. Griffin also worked in the Phoenix Suns' front office from 1993 until 2009, a stint that overlapped with Gentry's time as both a Suns assistant and head coach.Griffin was among six people interviewed by the Pelicans to replace Demps, including interim general manager Danny Ferry, Golden State assistant GM Larry Harris, Brooklyn Nets assistant GM Trajan Langon, Houston Rockets assistant GM Gersson Rosas and interim Washington president of basketball operations Tommy Sheppard.Now Griffin will attempt to transform a franchise that went 33-49 this season and has slightly better than a 25 percent chance of landing a top four pick in the NBA draft lottery on May 14.Trading Davis also could fetch a high draft choice, if Griffin chooses to go that route.Gentry has a regular-season record of 145-183 with one playoff appearance last season and one playoff series victory — a sweep of Portland before losing in five games to eventual champion Golden State.Although the Pelicans struggled this season, Gentry was commended by his players for his professionalism amid difficult circumstances."He's kind of been the guy who has let us grow," said Pelicans guard Jrue Holiday, who is coming off the best season of his 10-year NBA career. "I know he has for sure let me grow. He's given me responsibility ... and when he saw me succeed in it, he asked for more."Sometimes there's coaches that you kind of feel like they're holding you back as a player and kind of restrict you, but I feel like he kind of just lets you go and figure it out yourself," Holiday said earlier this week. "He's always been like a partner instead of like a dictator, and I feel like for professionals like ourselves and the guys in the locker room, we really respect that."Davis, who averaged 25.9 points, 12 rebounds and 2.4 blocks in 56 games, made his trade demand with 32 games left in the season and wound up missing 17 of those games, sometimes for rest and at other times was listed as out with back spasms, including for the final seven games.When he did play, it was rarely for much more than 20 minutes a game.The Pelicans will have a number of other pressing roster matters as well.Starting forward Julius Randle and starting point guard Elfrid Payton both will be free agents. Randle is coming off of the best season of his career — averaging 21.4 points and 8.7 rebounds. He credited the Pelicans with fostering his development and said he's open to coming back.Payton, who is from the New Orleans area, said playing in his hometown exceeded expectations and that he would like to be back. Payton missed much of the season with injuries, but also put together a historically significant string of five straight triple-doubles this spring.___Advertisement

But Johnson repeatedly mentioned Buss' affinity for Walton and Johnson's desire not to cause upheaval between them.Johnson also says he's tired of being fined by the NBA for tampering.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressA look at where things stand in the NBA playoff picture, with four days remaining in the regular season:EASTERN CONFERENCEMiami controls its destiny, which sounds good.Miami could also be eliminated on Sunday as well.And Dwyane Wade's "One Last Dance" might end without a playoff berth.The Heat have not dropped four straight games at any point this season. It would be in their best interest for that statement to remain accurate on Sunday, when Miami — losers of three straight — gets the rare noon tip-off at Toronto. If the Heat win, they remain alive regardless of other outcomes. If they lose, it might be over.In fact, the remaining three spots in the Eastern Conference field could be claimed on Sunday. If Miami loses, and Brooklyn wins, and Detroit wins, the field will be set. If Miami wins, then the race is guaranteed to extend to at least Tuesday. And if the Heat go 3-0 in the next four days — after the game at Toronto, they host Philadelphia on Tuesday and visit Brooklyn on Wednesday — they're in the playoffs."You want to win in the playoffs, you have to learn how to win pressure games and games with expectation and consequences during the regular season," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "This can't feel any more like the playoffs right now. Our backs are fully against the wall. I just think this is an awesome experience for our team. You have to find a way to embrace this and rise to the challenge."Philadelphia cut its magic number for clinching the No. 3 spot to one by defeating Chicago on Saturday. In the only other game on the NBA schedule — intentionally made light by the schedule-makers because of the NCAA Final Four going on — Brooklyn went up one spot to sixth, passing Orlando, by holding off Milwaukee on Saturday. The Bucks rested Giannis Antetokounmpo in that one because of a calf issue.But all was not lost for the Magic.Orlando can clinch its first playoff berth since 2012 on Sunday; the Magic would get in if they win at Boston, or if Miami and Charlotte both lose. If the Magic don't beat the Celtics, then Boston would secure a top-four spot and home-court for the first round.WESTERN CONFERENCEOracle Arena will play host to more games. Probably a lot more games, to be honest, unless the Golden State Warriors get stunned in the early rounds of these playoffs.But on Sunday night, the Warriors will play a regular-season game there for the 1,936th, and last, time.And they could close that chapter at their Oakland home in style: A win over the Los Angeles Clippers in the home regular-season finale on Sunday would secure the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference race for the two-time defending NBA champions, who are moving to the brand-new Chase Center in San Francisco starting next season."We've got one more before we can seal up the No. 1 seed and take care of that goal," Warriors star Stephen Curry said. "These next three games are just about finishing the right way. I'm happy with where we are as a team, taking care of our business, and we'll figure out who we're going to play next weekend and we'll go from there."Warriors-Clippers could be the West's headline game Sunday night, though many others will have a say in the seeding races.Denver will look to sweep a home-and-home against the Trail Blazers when the teams meet in Portland. But the Nuggets are sitting Nikola Jokic, Paul Millsap and Jamal Murray to rest, which certainly helps out the Blazers.Houston will be a very big favorite over Phoenix, and the Rockets could still get to No. 2 in the West — the spot currently held by Denver, which cannot slip past No. 3. Portland would be assured of the No. 4 spot with a 3-0 finish, while Utah, San Antonio and Oklahoma City also have games that matter seeding-wise Sunday.SUNDAY'S GAMES— Miami at Toronto: Toronto is the No. 2 seed in the East and still could be No. 2 in the NBA. Miami has almost no more room for error.— San Antonio at Cleveland: This is a game that the Spurs should win, unless for some reason they want Golden State in the first round.— Oklahoma City at Minnesota: See above. Unless the Thunder want to see Golden State in the first round, they likely need to win this one.— Charlotte at Detroit: Pistons aren't as desperate as the Hornets, who need a 3-0 finish and help to get in. Detroit can still get No. 6 seed.— Brooklyn at Indiana: Nets went to 6th on Saturday, and will finish there if they win out. Pacers know they're likely going to be the 5 seed.— Phoenix at Houston: Rockets can still get to No. 2 seed if things break their way. The Suns have lost 239 games in the last four years.— Orlando at Boston: Magic will clinch their first playoff spot since 2012 with a win. Celtics will wrap up home-court for Round 1 with a win.— L.A. Clippers at Golden State: Warriors coach Steve Kerr has won at least 55 games in all five of his seasons. L.A. playing for 6th, 7th or 8th.— Denver at Portland: The resting-up Nuggets still can finish with No. 2 seed. Blazers may get to 3rd seed, trying to hold off Jazz for 4th.— Utah at L.A. Lakers: The Jazz are 31-10 in their last 41 games, yet still might not get home-court for Round 1. Extremely dangerous team.Games with no playoff implications: Dallas at Memphis, Atlanta at Milwaukee, Washington at New York, New Orleans at Sacramento.___CURRENT BRACKETFirst-round matchups if the season ended Saturday ...East: 1-Milwaukee vs. 8-Detroit, 2-Toronto vs. 7-Orlando, 3-Philadelphia vs. 6-Brooklyn, 4-Boston vs. 5-Indiana.West: 1-Golden State vs. 8-San Antonio, 2-Denver vs. 7-Oklahoma City, 3-Houston vs. 6-L.A.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressDALLAS — Dallas Mavericks star Dirk Nowitzki announced his retirement from the NBA after a record 21 seasons with the same franchise, giving the fans the secret he had kept all season after scoring 30 points in his final home game, a 120-109 win over the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday night.The 40-year-old showed his emotion during the game, fighting back tears just before action resumed at the start of the second quarter following a tribute video that detailed his holiday visit to a children's hospital.Nowitzki's final basket in Dallas was his signature one-legged fadeaway from slightly above the free throw line for a 120-108 lead with 1:22 remaining after the Mavericks had let a 30-point halftime cushion get cut to four in the fourth quarter.After speeches from Larry Bird and others he idolized growing up in Germany, Nowitzki told the crowd, "As you guys might expect, this is my last home game."The sellout crowd that followed owner Mark Cuban's orders by showing up early chanted "M-V-P" and "One more year" throughout the game. But after he made the announcement, the chant turned to "Thank you, Dirk" as Cuban started to speak.The 14-time All-Star has one game remaining, Dallas' season finale at San Antonio on Wednesday night."This is obviously super, super emotional," Nowitzki said. "Just too many people to really thank. I put you guys on a helluva ride with a lot of ups and downs, and you guys always stuck with me and supported me, so I appreciate it."Larger-than-life placards of Nowitzki's face were perched on most of the roughly 20,000 seats at American Airlines Center, and a huge mural hung over one of the entrances to the arena.Nowitzki, a few steps slower than in his prime and a role player on a team now led by rookie sensation and fellow European Luka Doncic, was serenaded in every road arena like it was a farewell tour.Last month, he gave the home folks the thrill of passing Wilt Chamberlain to regain sixth on the career scoring list. Nowitzki reached that spot last season, but LeBron James passed him. Nowitzki, who led the Mavericks to their only championship in 2011, has 31,540 points with one game left.The NBA's highest-scoring foreign-born player broke Kobe Bryant's record of 20 seasons with the same franchise, although it took longer than expected because of setbacks following ankle surgery that sidelined Nowitzki for the first 26 games. Bryant retired from the Lakers three years ago.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersDwyane Wade was hoping to extend his legendary career into at least four postseason games.Instead, Wade's career will end Wednesday night when the Heat visit the playoff-bound Brooklyn Nets, who can clinch the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference.Wade, 37, announced his retirement on Sept 16 before training camp began, and this season has been a farewell tour filled with a few magical moments and some postgame jersey exchanges.Despite the good feelings of celebrating Wade's storied career, which began as the No. 5 overall draft pick in 2003 and includes NBA championships in 2006, 2012 and 2013, the Heat were unable to do enough to reach the postseason this year.Miami was formally eliminated Tuesday night as Wade's career was celebrated in front of home fans for the final time. Wade scored 30 points in his first start of the season in a 122-99 rout of the Philadelphia 76ers, exited to a standing ovation in the final minute and exchanged jerseys with Jimmy Butler."I'm still just amazed, even after all these years," Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. "I've seen him go into his bag of tricks so many times and just compartmentalize. But I'm truly amazed that he was able to perform like that tonight."Wade's final moments in front of the home fans occurred after the Detroit Pistons (40-41) stormed back from a 22-point deficit to beat the Memphis Grizzlies and eliminate the Heat (39-42).Miami will miss the postseason for the third time in five seasons since LeBron James returned to Cleveland in 2014.The Heat were one game over .500 three times but only reached the .500 mark once since Jan. 27 and were done in by losing four straight before Tuesday.Brooklyn (41-40) will face either third-seeded Philadelphia or second-seeded Toronto in the first round of the playoffs. The Nets are even with Orlando but own the head-the-head tiebreaker and would finish sixth with a win or if the Magic lose Wednesday at Charlotte.The Nets are in this position because of what unfolded in a challenging road back-to-back set. After getting a five-point win at Milwaukee on Saturday, Brooklyn led most of the way and celebrated clinching a playoff berth with a 108-96 victory at Indiana on Sunday."To be honest, it is a big moment for us and a big moment for the organization, from where we've come from in the last couple of years, the improvement that we've had individually and collectively," Nets guard Joe Harris said at practice Tuesday. "Just to clinch a playoff spot, it's a big moment for the organization for sure, and we're all very happy. But at the same time, we still have Miami left to finish out the year the right way, and we still want to make some noise in the playoffs and make it competitive."By clinching Sunday, the Nets are in a position to rest players, and two may be out. DeMarre Carroll will sit out due to a sprained right wrist while Harris -- who leads the NBA in 3-point shooting percentage -- is questionable because of a sore right foot.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement

It's also the first time since 2014-15 the Nets have not posted a losing record.Domantas Sabonis finished with 17 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Pacers. Thaddeus Young scored 16 in a game coach Nate McMillan promised to closely monitor the minutes his players logged.And Brooklyn wasted no time in taking full advantage of that opportunity to end the NBA's sixth-longest active playoff drought.The Nets scored the first nine points and forced three turnovers in less than two minutes, an early barrage that forced Indiana to spend most of the game playing catch-up.Twice the Pacers took the lead on 3-pointers, from Myles Turner and Wesley Matthews, but Russell answered the second one with a 9-footer to give Brooklyn a 19-18 lead with 4:19 left in the first quarter.Indiana never led again.Instead, the Nets steadily extended the lead.

This time, however, the tears it stirred were tears of joy.LaMarcus Aldridge had 34 points and 16 rebounds and the Spurs beat the Dallas Mavericks 105-94 Wednesday night in Nowitzki's final game."Everybody, players, fans, coaches and staff got to witness history watching him play his last game," San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said. "He played a fine game, which was great. It's not surprising."Nowitzki finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds in the finale of his storied 21-season career — all with the Mavericks. Nowitzki announced he was retiring Tuesday night following Dallas' final home game of the season.Wednesday's sell-out crowd cheered wildly each time Nowitzki entered the game or touched the ball and let out a collective groan when he missed a shot. He was serenaded with chants of "MVP!" throughout the game by the crowd filled with patrons wearing his No. 41 jersey."It was fantastic again tonight," Nowitzki said. "Felt almost like a home game, honestly."The Spurs couldn't afford any sentimentality with playoff positioning at stake, and they didn't show any. San Antonio raced to a double-figure lead and led by as many as 22 points.The Spurs finished seventh in the Western Conference as a result of Oklahoma City's 127-116 victory over Milwaukee. They will face the No. 2 seed, either Denver or Houston, in the opening round of the playoffs.The regular-season finale turned out to be a win for everyone. San Antonio won, Nowitzki led the Mavericks in scoring and Popovich, the Spurs and San Antonio's fans got to say goodbye to the future Hall of Famer."He was having a lot of fun tonight, I was really happy for him," Popovich said.It was appropriate that Nowitzki's final game came against the Spurs, who he has had many memorable battles against. Perhaps the most memorable was the 2006 Western Conference finals against San Antonio. After the Spurs battled back from a 3-1 series deficit and a 20-point lead in Game 7, Manu Ginobili fouled Nowitzki on a layup with 21.6 seconds remaining. Nowitzki made the free throw to forge a tie and the Mavs went on to win in overtime on the way to the franchise's first NBA Finals appearance."If it's not at home, this kind of works perfect," Nowitzki said of San Antonio. "This team was always sort of the big brother. They were beating us and then we kind of found a way to get through them in '06. To me, probably still one of the best playoff series I've been a part of and probably some of the best basketball in that series that I've ever played in my life."Nowitzki was able to turn back the clock, shooting 8 for 21 in 32 minutes, including going 2 for 6 on 3-pointers. His final shot was a 20-footer over Spurs rookie Drew Eubanks with 49.7 seconds remaining.Dallas coach Rick Carlisle subbed Nowitzki following the shot, leading to an ovation of cheers and chants of "Dirk" and "MVP.""It's cool playing against Dirk tonight," Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said.

The two-time defending NBA champion Warriors said Cousins will begin rehabilitation immediately and updates will be "provided as appropriate."Coach Steve Kerr said after the Warriors' 135-131 Game 2 loss on Monday night that Cousins would be out for a significant period.Playing in just his second career postseason game after a nine-year wait, Cousins went down in the first quarter in front of the Golden State bench after swiping a ball from Patrick Beverley in the back court. He immediately grabbed at his left quad. Cousins hobbled to the locker room at the 8:09 mark.Cousins had just returned in January from a nearly yearlong absence following surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon suffered while with the Pelicans last season.He had two points, two rebounds and an assist in less than 4 minutes Monday. He fouled out of Saturday's 121-104 Game 1 win with nine points, nine rebounds and four assists in 21 minutes."I know it's frustrating for him. I've been through something like that, getting hurt, getting all the way back and then getting hurt again, so I know how frustrating it is," Warriors center Kevon Looney said. "He is a resilient guy. He's been through adversity before and I know he's going to bounce back. His spirit is probably low right now, but he's a tough guy and he'll be back better than ever."Looney picked up more minutes with Cousins' injury and scored a career-high 19 points while making all six of his shots in 19 minutes. Kerr is likely to use a combination of shot-blocking presence Andrew Bogut and Looney going forward this postseason.Bogut's signing last month for a second stint with the franchise means so much more now. Kerr called him an "insurance policy" and Bogut — who had been playing back home in Australia — has made the most of his chances. He had nine rebounds, three points and a blocked shot in 16 minutes Monday.He played on the Warriors' 2015 championship team and the 73-win team the following season that lost in Game 7 of the NBA Finals to LeBron James and the Cavaliers.The No. 1 overall draft pick in 2005 out of Utah, Bogut has been open to any role Kerr chooses for him, which now could be starting."Obviously, there will be more minutes," he said after the game. "It'll still be matchup dependent, but I anticipate probably starting games, playing the first three or four minutes and then coming out."Stephen Curry expects the backups to fill the void as the Warriors' depth has done all season, with Jordan Bell also likely to be in the mix."Exactly what they've been doing. They've been playing amazing the last part of the regular season and these first two games," Curry said. "... It may look a little different considering the skill and talent and level that Boogie can bring when he's healthy."___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressCLEVELAND — The Cavaliers' next coach will inherit a better situation than the one Larry Drew got handed.Drew and the Cavs parted ways Thursday after a challenging, 19-win season that followed LeBron James leaving for Los Angeles and included a rash of injuries to a young roster.Although expected, Drew's departure creates more work for a franchise that will sit out the NBA playoffs this season following a four-year run in the Finals with James.The 61-year-old Drew met with general manager Koby Altman, and the two decided it was best if they went in separate directions. Altman said in a release that Drew "respectfully declined to participate in the search process and will not be returning to coach the Cavaliers."The Cavs tied for the league's second-worst record with Phoenix, but Drew kept his team playing hard until the end. He received praise from many of his players, including All-Star forward Kevin Love, who was limited to just 22 games following toe surgery."We have great respect and appreciation for Larry and the job that he did as the head coach of the Cavaliers for nearly the entire 2018-19 campaign. He brought professionalism, class and steady leadership both this past season and prior four years," Altman said in a release. "All of us in Cleveland wish Larry nothing but the best going forward."Altman will embark on a search for Cleveland's fifth coach since 2013. The Cavs will consider college coaches, NBA assistants and former head coaches to continue the rebuild Drew started.Altman is scheduled to outline some of his plans during a news conference Friday at the team's facility in Independence.The Cavs' job is enticing on several fronts. Owner Dan Gilbert has displayed a willingness to spend and Cleveland could land one of the top college prospects depending on how things go in next month's draft lottery.Drew took over when Tyronn Lue, who led the Cavs to a title in 2016, was fired Oct. 28 following a 0-6 start. The 61-year-old Drew spent three seasons with the Cavs, joining Lue's staff for the championship season.When he replaced Lue, Drew, who previously coached in Atlanta and Milwaukee, knew the Cavs might go in another direction at some point and asked the team to restructure his contract.Drew's steadying influence helped the Cavs endure injuries which led to him use a league-high 32 different lineups. He also helped in the development of rookie point guard Collin Sexton, who finished strong after a slow start and appears to be a building block for the future."I want to thank Dan Gilbert, Koby Altman, the entire organization, and especially our fans, for what has been a very special and rewarding time here in Cleveland," Drew said. "Koby and I had a good discussion following the season and have both decided that the best decision for each of us was that I would not return to coach the team. I am very proud of what we accomplished over the last several years together and will always cherish our championship."I also want to commend our players this season for the bond that they established, the way they approached their jobs and the hard work and growth they had every day. I am very proud of them and wish them the best as they continue to develop for the future."___Advertisement

Charlotte did its part and must now beat Orlando at home on Wednesday and hope the Pistons (39-42) lose in New York to clinch its first playoff berth in three years.Detroit rallied to beat Memphis 100-93, setting up a dramatic final day of the season.Jeremy Lamb added 23 points and Miles Bridges and Dwayne Bacon scored 18 apiece as the Hornets won their fourth straight.The Cavs dropped their 10th in a row to finish 19-63, the fourth-worst record in franchise history and just the fifth time they've failed to win at least 20.Cleveland again played without star forward Kevin Love, whose season was sabotaged early by a toe injury that required surgery and altered everything for the Cavs. Love's situation made things even tougher on the Cavs, who initially believed they could compete while recovering from the loss of James as a free agent for the second time.Now the focus turns to coach Larry Drew's future and next month's NBA draft lottery.Rookie Collin Sexton scored 18 points and had a season-high 10 assists for the Cavs. He also joined Larry Bird (1979-80) and Stephen Curry (2009-10) as the only rookies in league history to average at least 16 points while making over 40% of their 3-pointers and 80% of their free throws.If the Hornets get back to the postseason for the first time in three years, Walker will be the reason.The three-time All-Star, who is scheduled to become a free agent on July 1, is averaging 34.4 points in his last five games.TIP-INSHornets: F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist was not with the team for the second straight game because of personal reasons. ... Walker enters Wednesday's game — perhaps the final one of his career with Charlotte — as the franchise leader in points and made 3-pointers, field goals and free throws. He's second in assists behind Muggsy Bogues and third in games played behind Dell Curry and Bogues.Cavaliers: Love played 13 minutes on Sunday as a salute to close friend Channing Frye, who is retiring after 13 seasons. Love was limited to just 22 games this season because of the toe and other injuries. He'll consider playing this summer for Team USA. ... Frye was given a rousing ovation when he checked in and a video tribute from former teammates was shown. Dwyane Wade said, "I thought you already retired." Frye scored 10 in the fourth quarter. ...

The Clippers confirmed it's the best comeback ever."That's a record we didn't necessarily want to have. We'll take it," Williams said. "You're competitive and you get lost in the game. Once you cut the lead to 12, you cut the lead to 10, then you realize you've got a game going. I'm one of those guys who can get hot."Curry scored 29 points and put the Warriors up 131-128 with 58 seconds left before Shamet's dagger on a night the two-time defending NBA champions lost DeMarcus Cousins to a leg injury in the first quarter."We changed a couple things offensively and defensively in the third on the fly. It worked out for us. But I thought it was our spirit more than anything," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "Just every single guy. I loved the end of the game."Williams tied the game on a jumper with 1:10 to play then Curry immediately answered. Williams scored again at 46 seconds and finished with 36 points and made 8 of 10 free throws in as the teams combined for 64 fouls and 76 free throws attempted."When I say we stopped playing, we stopped playing, like defense, offense, execution-wise we were not as engaged as we needed to be," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "We got exactly what we deserved. The Clippers were great. They executed, they were hungry, they stayed connected. They were together."Cousins injured his left quadriceps muscle in the first quarter and was done for the game, but Golden State's depth shined and the Warriors built a 23-point halftime lead they pushed to a 31-point advantage before failing to hold off Los Angeles late.Williams' jumper and three-point play with 5:34 left pulled the Clippers within 120-117 then he rebounded his own miss and scored the putback at the 5:05 mark and cut it to 121-119."The wheels fell off," Curry said.Cousins was scheduled to undergo an MRI exam after the injury in just his second career playoff game following a nine-year wait. The big man returned in January from a nearly year-long absence following surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon.He won't play in Game 3 on Thursday at Staples Center and Cousins' entire postseason is in serious doubt.Kerr said Cousins will be out "a while.""There's a pretty significant quad injury," Kerr said.Cousins hobbled to the locker room at the 8:09 mark of the first quarter. At the 8 1/2-minute mark Cousins stole the ball from Patrick Beverley in the back court and tried to retrieve the loose ball when went down in front of the Golden State bench and grabbed at his left quad.LeBron James tweeted prayers for Cousins, who fouled out of Saturday's 121-104 Game 1 win with nine points, nine rebounds and four assists in 21 minutes.Kevon Looney picked up the bulk of the extra minutes in Cousins' absence and scored a career-high 19 points making all six of his shots but the Warriors had their seven-game postseason winning streak snapped that dated to last year's run to a repeat championship. Durant had 21 points, five rebounds and five assists, Klay Thompson scored 17 points and Draymond Green 14 with nine assists.Curry followed up a 38-point performance in Game 1 that gave him the most 3s in postseason history with another nice showing but Golden State hurt itself with too many miscues.The Warriors committed 21 turnovers in Game 1, then 22 more Monday — nine by Durant."We let our guard down. We weren't the aggressors anymore. We didn't deserve to win that game," Thompson said.Los Angeles wanted to do a better job stopping the late bursts each quarter the Warriors had in Game 1, and the Clippers were somehow able to claw their way back.Both coaches challenged their teams to be more poised in Game 2 following the ejections of Beverley and Durant in the opener. Beverley again pushed the limits but the sides avoided a testy encore, and he fouled out with 4:33 to go to roaring cheers from the sellout crowd. Kevin Durant fouled out at 1:21 with a third straight offensive foul.DURANT'S APOLOGYAt morning shootaround, Durant apologized for being tossed from Game 1.The two-time reigning finals MVP has two technicals, and if he reaches seven during the postseason it brings an automatic one-game suspension."I don't want to disappoint my coaches and my fan base and owners who expect me to be out on the floor, so I apologize for being thrown out the game," Durant said. "Just keep my mouth shut, just play the game. Simple."DOC APPRECIATES GOOD DEEDDoc Rivers dropped $2,000 cash on the street in San Francisco earlier in the day — and offered a pregame "shoutout" to the man with the integrity to return the money."Kept walking, didn't know it. The guy tapped me on the back and said, 'that's your money,'" Rivers shared. "I don't know a lot of places that that would happen, but it happened today, so whoever that was he could have had free tickets if you hadn't ran away."TIP-INSClippers: Williams scored 17 points in the third to match Chris Paul's postseason franchise record done May 5, 2014, against Oklahoma City. ... The L.A. backups scored another 83 points after getting 65 in the opener. In fact, in Game 1, Harrell (26) and Williams (25) were the first teammates to come off the bench and score 25 or more points in a postseason game since bench stats began in 1970-71, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Warriors: With his 129th career playoff game, Durant passed Kerr for 73rd place on the NBA's all-time list. ...

Jokic stripped Andrew Wiggins, who led the Timberwolves with 25 points, and then sank two free throws for a three-point cushion.Wiggins' 3-pointer to tie it hit the front of the rim and the Nuggets got the ball back. Paul Millsap was fouled at the other end with 4.2 seconds remaining. He sank his first free throw and missed his second, but teammate Will Barton corralled the rebound and dribbled out the clock.Gorgui Dieng added 18 points for the Timberwolves backups and rookie Cameron Reynolds scored a career-best 17 points, including a 3-pointer that put Minnesota ahead 95-84 with 4:01 left.They wouldn't score again.Jokic also pulled down 14 rebounds one night after his worst game of the year, one in which he scored just two points before fouling out in 16 minutes in a loss at Utah.A year ago, these two teams met on the final day of the regular season with a lot more at stake. The Timberwolves won that one in overtime in the first final-day play-in game in the NBA in 21 years, ending a 14-year playoff absence and extending Denver's drought to six seasons.Then, All-Star Jimmy Butler demanded a trade that torpedoed the Timberwolves, who fell to 36-46 and reverted to also-ran status while the Nuggets put together a 54-28 breakout for their first trip to the playoffs since 2012-13."Each one of our players deserves credit, because they've all bought in from Day 1," Malone said. "And I think we've used that motivation of losing in Minneapolis last year Game 82 because coming up short two years in a row is really hard and it's kind of motivated us to be the team we are right now."TIP-INS:Timberwolves: Minnesota played without starters Karl Anthony-Towns (right knee), Jeff Teague (left foot) and Robert Covington (right knee) and key reserves Taj Gibson (left calf) and Derrick Rose (right elbow).Nuggets: Denver finished an NBA-best 34-7 at home. ...

Oklahoma City made a franchise-record 23 3-pointers and handed out a franchise-best 40 assists, converting 48 of 99 shots to win their fifth in a row."Good teams always respond," Schroder said. "We do whatever it takes to go out there and compete and play with each other. We live with the result."Now the playoffs come.

San Antonio came into the day in eighth place, which would mean an early matchup with defending champion Golden State.However, the Spurs can still move ahead of Oklahoma City and the Los Angeles Clippers as they own tiebreakers with both teams.DeMar DeRozan and Patty Mills added 14 points apiece for the balanced Spurs, who turned back every Cleveland challenge in the second half. Mills made three 3-pointers in a two-minute span early in the fourth quarter to end any chances of the Cavs rallying.Rookie Collin Sexton and Brandon Knight scored 16 each for Cleveland, and the Cavs celebrated the upcoming retirement of forward Channing Frye throughout the game.Kevin Love returned after missing four games and played 13 minutes in the first half — a salute to Frye, his close friend.San Antonio didn't pull away from Cleveland until midway through the second quarter and the Spurs used a 9-0 run over the final 2:05 to open a 62-46 halftime lead.With the popular Frye retiring after Tuesday's game and 13 seasons, Cavs coach Larry Drew started the 35-year-old for the first time since Jan. 9.Love wanted to play alongside Frye one last time and subbed in during the first quarter wearing his friend's No. 45 college jersey from the University of Arizona over his Cavaliers' jersey.

Rio Grande Valley won the series 2-1, and added this title to ones the franchise claimed in 2010 and 2013 when what's now the G League was known as the NBA Development League.A 24-2 run in the second quarter put the game away for the Vipers, who lost Game 1 of the title series before rallying to win the title.Hartenstein made a pair of 3-pointers in an early 8-0 run that put the Vipers up 30-16, and the barrage in the second quarter left no doubt.

"Let's make it a home atmosphere, because we need everything."The Milwaukee-Detroit matchup is one of two series shifting sites Saturday. Houston and Utah will also play Game 3 in Salt Lake City. There are a couple Game 4s on tap as well: Philadelphia at Brooklyn, and Denver at San Antonio.The Pistons are in their second season at their new arena, but even after moving downtown, they've had their share of small, dreary crowds — similar to the atmosphere during their final years at The Palace of Auburn Hills. But there's every reason to expect a more charged scene Saturday night. Little Caesars Arena has hosted the NCAA and Horizon League tournaments in basketball, but there have been no home playoff games yet for the Pistons — or for the Red Wings, who also play there."I hope we're building trust with our fans by getting the first step of getting into the playoffs, because we have some great, knowledgeable basketball fans here in Detroit," Casey said. "We've got to make sure we come out and represent them, but we need all them to come out the way they treated us in Milwaukee — like we stole something."The Pistons were drubbed in the series opener 121-86. They played better in Game 2, even leading at halftime, but they still lost 120-99 to the top-seeded Bucks.Houston is also up 2-0 in its series against Utah. James Harden is coming off a triple-double of 32 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists Wednesday night. The Rockets won the first two games by a combined 52 points.Philadelphia leads Brooklyn 2-1 after winning on the road Thursday night. The 76ers were held to 102 points in a Game 1 loss but have been impressive since, winning 145-123 in Game 2 and then 131-115 on Thursday . Tobias Harris made all six of his 3-point attempts in Game 3.San Antonio took a 2-1 lead over Denver with a 118-108 victory in Game 3. Derrick White scored a career-high 36 points.A look at Saturday's games:76ERS AT NETS76ers lead, 2-1. Game 4, 3 p.m. EDT, TNT.NEED TO KNOW: Philadelphia coach Brett Brown isn't sure if Joel Embiid will play, but the 76ers were just fine without their All-Star center in Game 3.KEEP AN EYE ON: Brooklyn's lineup combinations. D'Angelo Russell, Spencer Dinwiddie and Caris LeVert all had big games when the Nets won the opener, so coach Kenny Atkinson needs to figure out how much he can get his best ball handlers on the floor for more time, while still being able to rebound and defend against a much bigger lineup.INJURY WATCH: Embiid worked out Friday at practice but Brown said he didn't have a gut feeling either way whether Embiid's left knee would feel well enough for him to play. The Sixers have depth behind him with Greg Monroe and Boban Marjanovic, who combined for 23 points and 21 rebounds in Game 3."It's not a knock on anyone else, but there is a significant drop-off when you take an All-NBA player out of the lineup," guard JJ Redick said.PRESSURE IS ON: Joe Harris. Brooklyn's guard led the NBA in 3-point percentage during the regular season but was 0 for 4 behind the arc in Game 3. He also struggled to stay close to Redick on defense, and Redick responded with five 3s and 26 points. The Nets need Harris to be better on both ends.NUGGETS AT SPURSSpurs lead, 2-1. Game 4, 5:30 p.m. EDT, TNT.NEED TO KNOW: Denver has won only six of its last 37 road games in the playoffs, and three of those came during the 2008-09 season, when the Nuggets reached the conference finals. That's the only time Denver made it past the first round in its last 11 postseason appearances. On the road against San Antonio specifically, the Nuggets have lost four straight playoff games and 13 straight regular-season games.KEEP AN EYE ON: Denver was second in the NBA with 11.9 offensive rebounds per game during the regular season, but San Antonio has bested the Nuggets in that category during this series. The Spurs have 36 offensive rebounds through three games, and Denver has 30.MARQUEE MATCHUP: White had a big game for the Spurs in Game 3, but Denver's Jamal Murray finished Game 2 with a flourish, scoring 21 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter.PRESSURE IS ON: Nikola Jokic has averaged 17.7 points in the series, which certainly isn't bad. But with Denver on the road and trying to avoid a 3-1 deficit in the series, the Nuggets' 7-footer will be on the spot.BUCKS AT PISTONSBucks lead, 2-0. Game 3, 8 p.m. EDT, ESPN.NEED TO KNOW: Detroit has lost 12 straight playoff games dating to 2008.KEEP AN EYE ON: Pat Connaughton scored 28 points for Milwaukee over the first two games, shooting 12 of 16 from the field. It's hard enough to beat the Bucks when Giannis Antetokounmpo and Eric Bledsoe are rolling, but if players like Connaughton are making major contributions, these games can become blowouts.INJURY WATCH: Pistons star Blake Griffin missed the first two games of the series with knee issues.PRESSURE IS ON: Detroit picked up Thon Maker in a trade this season, and he could be an intriguing player for the Pistons in the future, but Griffin's injury has forced him to play an important role in this series, and he has only 10 points so far. He went 0 for 9 from 3-point range over the first two games.ROCKETS AT JAZZRockets lead, 2-0. Game 3, 10:30 p.m. EDT, ESPN.NEED TO KNOW: The series has been surprisingly uncompetitive thus far, with Houston leading by at least 17 points throughout the second half of its victory in Game 2, after leading by double digits for the entire fourth quarter of the opener.KEEP AN EYE ON: Harden's playmaking. Harden is getting everyone involved, with 10 assists in both games after he managed just 4.8 per game against Utah during the regular season.TELLS THE STORY: Utah held opponents to an EFG% of 50.7 during the regular season, the second-best defensive mark in the league in that category. In this series, Houston is all the way up at 58.3 against the Jazz.PRESSURE IS ON: Utah's offense. Even a defense as tough as Utah's isn't going to stop Houston entirely, so the Jazz have to find a way to cobble together more points.___Follow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister___Advertisement

Michigan State. The Spartans made it to the Final Four without Joshua Langford. He should be healthy and nearly everyone should be back.2. Virginia. De'Andre Hunter is a projected NBA lottery pick, so he's likely be gone. If Ty Jerome returns, the Cavaliers could be in the running for a second straight title.3. Kentucky. Another year, another big roster turnover. Then again, Coach John Calipari has another stellar recruiting class coming in.4. Michigan. The Wolverines were not supposed be this good this year. Even with Charles Matthews likely leaving, they're expected to be good in 2019-20 if no one else leaves.5. Duke. Zion, R.J. and Cam will not be back. Tre Jones is, so the Blue Devils should be in good shape with another top-notch recruiting class coming to Durham.6. Marquette. Ranking the Golden Eagles this high is all about Markus Howard. He doesn't come back, they drop several spots.7. Gonzaga. Rui Hachimura may leave Spokane early, but if Brandon Clarke doesn't, watch out for the Zags.8. Oregon. No Bol Bol (likely), but Payton Pritchard, Louis King (maybe) and a strong recruiting class is going to be tough to beat.9. Kansas. The Lawson brothers are gone, but getting the big Doke back is huge for the Jayhawks.10. Maryland. Losing Bruno Fernando would hurt, but there's a lot coming back.11. Ohio State. The starting backcourt graduates, but there are plenty of good young players to step up.12. Texas Tech. Losing Jarrett Culver, Matt Mooney and Tariq Owens hurts, but never count out Chris Beard after leading his host of grinders to the national title game.13. Louisville. Leading scorer Jordan Nwora could be off to the NBA, but Chris Mack is already pulling the recruiting strings.14. Arizona. Sean Miller regained his recruiting prowess with another stellar group coming in, though the federal investigation still hangs over the program.15. Villanova. The loss of Eric Paschal and Phil Booth puts a big dent in the Wildcats' leadership, but Jay Wright has dipped into the five-star recruiting pool with one of the nation's top classes.16. LSU. Another team caught up in the federal recruiting investigation. The Tigers have plenty coming back, though, particularly if point guard Tremont Waters stays.17. Florida State. Mfiondu Kabengele and a pair of top recruits should help make up for the losses of five seniors.18. North Carolina. The Tar Heels will have a massive roster turnover, but Ol' Roy should have high-quality replacements for them.19. Tennessee. Grant Williams and Jordan Bone returning could make the Vols a top-10 team. They'll be solid even if both leave.20. Arizona State. The Sun Devils may lose Luguentz Dort and Zylan Cheatham graduates, but nearly everyone else should be back from an NCAA Tournament team.21. Auburn. A healthy Chuma Okeke and getting Jared Harper back could lead to another deep Tigers' run.22. Seton Hall. The Pirates have plenty coming back and Myles Powell would make them a top 25 team.23. Saint Mary's. The Gaels get nearly everyone back from its tournament team.24. Iowa. This could be Fran McCaffrey's best team in Ames.25. Purdue. Losing Carsen Edwards to an early exit makes the Boilermakers much less dangerous.___Advertisement

"We're all making sure we're giving each other confidence and doing the little things to ensure we win. When you have that type of camaraderie, executing is a lot easier. Now that the stakes are higher, we're settling into who we want to be."While the names and numbers seem to change on a daily basis, the results have remained strikingly consistent.The Celtics turned Game 1 by limiting Indiana to eight third-quarter points and won by 10. In Game 2, the Celtics erased a double-digit deficit by allowing just 12 fourth-quarter points as they won by eight. This time, it was a 12-point third quarter that swung the momentum, leading Boston to its sixth straight win over Indiana — all since January.If they can do it one more time Sunday, last year's Eastern Conference runner-ups will be headed to the conference semifinals."In Game 4, we expect (Indiana) to take it to another level," Jaylen Brown said after scoring 23 points. "We've got to come out and not take our foot off the gas. We've got to come out and play great basketball and try to close this thing out."It seems Boston has an answer for every adjustment the Pacers make.With the league's best defense focused on holding Irving in check Friday, Brown went 8 of 9 from the field and grabbed seven rebounds Jayson Tatum added 18 points and seven rebounds and Irving was still productive with 19 points, 10 assists and five rebounds.For Indiana, it has been a nightmare of a series.After charging back from a 15-point first-quarter deficit to take a 61-59 halftime lead, Myles Turner opened the third with a 3-pointer to give the Pacers a five-point lead. Tyreke Evans matched his playoff career high with 19 points, 12 in the second quarter.But then the Celtics did it again.When Indiana's offense bogged down in the third, Boston scored eight straight points to retake the lead, closed the quarter on a 9-2 run and delivered the final blow with a 10-4 spurt late in the fourth to make it 98-92."In the third quarter, we lost our patience," Pacers coach Nate McMillan said. "We took quick shots, bailed them out, and lost our rhythm."TIP-INSCeltics: Tatum also had seven rebounds while Al Horford finished with 16 points and eight rebounds. ... The Celtics finished 15 of 34 on 3s after making 8 of 10 in the first quarter. ... Boston scored 41 points in the first quarter, the most Indiana has allowed in the first in its NBA playoff history. The Lakers set the previous mark, 38, during the 2000 NBA Finals.Pacers: Bojan Bogdanovic scored 15 points and Thaddeus Young had 11 points and nine rebounds. ...

Indiana now faces its second sweep in three years after never previously being swept in a best-of-seven series.RETURN ON HOLDAll-Star guard Victor Oladipo was expected to return to Bankers Life Fieldhouse for Game 3. Instead, bad weather in Florida prevented him from making it back.Oladipo hasn't appeared publicly in Bankers Life Fieldhouse since he was wheeled off the court on a stretcher with a ruptured quad tendon in his right knee In January. His presence was supposed to give the Pacers an emotional boost.The Pacers have not said if Oladipo will return for Game 4.THEY SAID ITCeltics: "I think he's fine. Turns out if you play 16 straight minutes, it cure all ills," Celtics coach Brad Stevens said when asked about Horford's availability for Game 3.Pacers: "It comes down to the third quarter. We've just got to figure out how to get off to a better start," Evans said.UP NEXTGame 4 is Sunday in Indianapolis.___Advertisement

"We play together and take what the opponent gives us. It isn't all about Giannis, as great and amazing as he is. We have a lot of guys who can make plays and Giannis knows when to step back and let them carry the load."The Bucks can finish off the Eastern Conference series Monday night in Detroit after winning the first three games by an average of 24 points.The Bucks overcame 27 points, seven rebounds and six assists from Blake Griffin in his return from a right knee injury. He missed the first two games of the series after sitting out four of the final six in the regular season."That young man is giving us everything his body will give, and we need every bit of it," Pistons coach Dwane Casey said. "He has a presence that no one else on our team can provide."Griffin had an immediate defensive impact, forcing two turnovers on Milwaukee's first three possessions, but struggled to keep up in transition."I don't know what percentage I'm at. I don't really worry about things like that," he said. "If I can play, I'm going to playAntetokounmpo had 14 points and 10 rebounds, and Khris Middleton led the Bucks with 20, Eric Bledsoe and Brook Lopez each had 19, and Lopez added seven rebounds and five blocks. Ersan Ilysaova (15), Nikola Mirotic (12) and George Hill (11) all reached double figures as part of the second unit."They came out strong in the first quarter and then Ersan came in and hit three straight threes to give us a lead," Middleton said. "That let us relax and play our own game."Andre Drummond had 12 points and 12 rebounds, struggling with his own foul trouble. He missed eight of his first nine field-goal attempts."I think Andre missed some bunnies and it bothered him," Casey said. "He took that to the other end of the floor and missed some assignments on defense. He's still learning how everything is magnified in the pressure of the playoffs."Drummond picked up his fourth foul early in the third quarter, but Antetokounmpo left a minute later with his fourth.Middleton, playing against the team that drafted him in 2012, hit back-to-back 3-pointers to give Milwaukee an 85-66 lead with 4:47 left in the third quarter. Drummond returned late in the quarter, but picked up his fifth foul after just 41 seconds."I thought they guys were amazing, especially after I got my fourth foul," Antetokounmpo said. "Khris did a great job of guiding the team and making the right plays. It's good to see us winning a playoff game on the road when I'm not having my best game."The margin was 100-78 at quarter's end and the Pistons never put together a serious run in the fourth."I think we definitely need some rest after Game 4, but we're trying not to think about that," Antetokounmpo said. "We're going to come in, be hungry and try to win that game. It's going to be a nice feeling — I've never won a playoff series."TIP INSBucks: The Bucks hadn't won the first three games of a playoff series since a three-game sweep of the New Jersey Nets in the 1986 first round. ... Milwaukee was a plus-23 in the 10:48 that George Hill played in the first half.Pistons: The game was the first postseason game in Little Caesars Arena history.

D'Angelo Russell had 25 points and 10 assists, reserve Caris LeVert scored 24 points and Dudley collected 14 of his season high-tying 16 points in the second half.The Nets, who had dropped four of five, moved into sixth place in the East. Orlando also is 40-40, and Detroit is a half-game back with a 39-40 record.The Nets have tiebreakers with both the Magic and Pistons.Milwaukee played without MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, who was sidelined by a left calf injury. The Bucks (59-21) clinched the NBA's best record with a road victory against Philadelphia on Thursday night."It was tough, even without Giannis," Dudley said. "I know that helped us. We just got key stops at the very end."I was playing center. They were going small ball. We wanted them to feel a little uncomfortable, having (Brook) Lopez having to guard a little more."Nets coach Kenny Atkinson called Dudley "the X factor" and said his instincts and understanding of the league contributed to Brooklyn's first win in four meetings with Milwaukee this season.Eric Bledsoe had 33 points and 11 assists for Milwaukee, and Khris Middleton finished with 24 points.Bledsoe's two foul shots made it 128-126 Bucks with 2:30 left, but the Nets closed the game with a 7-0 run. Russell made two free throws, Harris drilled his tiebreaking 3 and Russell drove for a basket with 59.1 seconds remaining."It was a room-and-rhythm look," Harris said of his triple. "Sometimes the best opportunity to get a 3 off is on an offensive rebound."Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said Antetokounmpo was kicked or hit in the calf against the 76ers and understood sitting out could help him get ready for the playoffs next week."There has been a significant amount of success and winning that has helped him be less difficult," Budenholzer said. "I have flashbacks to the first couple games; he was upset every time I took him out of the game.

"That was all the difference for us. We took control of the game right there in the first quarter and never lost control of it."The Warriors began the game on a 22-9 tear and went on to shoot 73% from the floor in the first, taking the crowd out of it early.Durant was perfect, making all five of his field goals and both free throws for 12 points. He and Curry picked up two fouls each, but the Warriors still built a 19-point lead."As much momentum as we lost in the final 16 minutes of Game 2, we got it all back early," Curry said. "Everybody was aggressive, decisive, getting good shots on every possession. The way we went about our business was the sign of a resilient team."Game 4 is Sunday at Staples Center.Kevon Looney, again filling in for injured DeMarcus Cousins, shot 4 for 4 in the first, dunking three times in a row.Durant had 27 points at halftime despite not making a 3-pointer.Golden State coach Steve Kerr had said he wanted Durant shooting much more than the eight times he did in Game 2. When relayed his coach's comment earlier in the week, Durant replied, "I don't play like that. I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am."The Clippers won Game 2 on the road after trailing by 31 points in the third quarter, stunning the Warriors with the largest comeback in NBA playoff history.But they couldn't find the basket this time, shooting 37% from the floor."They dissected us," Clippers coach Doc Rivers said. "You kind of felt they were going to come in and throw a punch, and we just didn't respond."The Clippers' only starter in double figures was rookie Ivica Zubac, who finished with 18 points after playing most of the fourth.

Wooden Award, given to the nation's top player.The honor comes on the heels of Williams winning the AP and Naismith player of the year awards. He also earned first-team All-America honors from numerous outlets.Williamson, 18, is the third freshman to win the Wooden Award, joining Kevin Durant (Texas, 2007) and Anthony Davis (Kentucky, 2012).Williamson averaged 22.6 points and 8.9 rebounds per game with the Blue Devils, throwing down highlight-reel dunks seemingly every game, many of them ending up as viral sensations.The Blue Devils went 32-6 this past season but lost to Michigan State in the regional final round of the NCAA Tournament.During the awards show on ESPN on Friday night, Williamson drew laughter from the crowd when he replied, "Umm, who knows" when asked if he would join fellow Duke freshmen RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish in declaring for the draft.Also during Friday's show, the national position player of the year awards were announced:--Bob Cousy Award (point guard): Ja Morant, Murray State--Jerry West Award (best shooting guard): Barrett--Julius Erving Award (small forward): Rui Hachimura, Gonzaga--Karl Malone Award (power forward): Williamson--Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award (center): Ethan Happ, WisconsinOn the women's side, Oregon junior Sabrina Ionescu picked up the Wooden Award.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressOpening day of the NBA postseason was no time to be home.Not home for the summer. Home for a game.Only the Golden State Warriors managed to win there Saturday in a rough day for the higher seeds. Both No. 2s lost, and the Brooklyn Nets won the game and the crowd in Philadelphia, where home fans turned on the third-seeded 76ers during an ugly performance.The 76ers will try to straighten things out when they host Game 2 on Monday, and the Warriors will try for more smooth sailing against the Clippers at Oracle Arena in the only other game scheduled.The Nets got the surprises started right from the very first game of the postseason when they beat the 76ers 111-102. Things couldn't have gone much worse for the Sixers, who couldn't quiet Brooklyn's guards or their own fans. The booing started early and grew stronger as the game went on, with Philadelphia All-Star Ben Simmons critical of the fans after being held to nine points while counterpart D'Angelo Russell had 26."We know that Game 2 will definitely be a lot harder for us," Nets guard Caris LeVert said. "We're ready for the challenge."Toronto was edged by Orlando, and Denver went down to San Antonio. But the Warriors made sure their home-court advantage didn't go to waste by beating the Clippers 121-104, getting their offense rolling early and keeping it going."Every game is different too," Stephen Curry said, "so who knows what will happen Game 2 and beyond."___Nets at 76ers, Brooklyn leads 1-0. Game 2, 8 p.m. EDT, TNT.NEED TO KNOW: The Nets will be trying for their first 2-0 lead in a series since going up 2-0 against the New York Knicks en route to a first-round sweep in 2004.KEEP AN EYE ON: The benches. Philadelphia may have one of the best starting fives in the NBA, but there's going to be an awful lot of pressure on the starters if the bench gets blown out as badly as in Game 1, when the Nets' reserves had a 59-28 scoring advantage.INJURY UPDATE: Joel Embiid is listed as questionable after he was doubtful on the eve of Game 1 with his sore knee. Nets veterans Ed Davis (sprained right ankle) and Jared Dudley (tight right calf) are being listed as questionable, though Davis said he expected to play after finishing with 12 points and 16 rebounds in the opener.PRESSURE IS ON: Simmons. Maybe he doesn't need to outplay high school teammate Russell, but the 76ers probably can't afford for LeVert (23 points) and Spencer Dinwiddie (18) to outplay him, too.___Clippers at Warriors, Golden State leads 1-0. Game 2, 10:30 p.m. EDT, TNT.NEED TO KNOW: Patrick Beverley and Kevin Durant insisted after their ejections in Game 1 they were just having fun and trash-talking in the heat of the playoffs. Whether those high emotions spill into Game 2 will be something to monitor considering if the two-time defending champion Warriors make a deep run again, Durant already has two technicals with seven bringing on an automatic suspension."Nah, I can control myself," Durant said, unconcerned.The officials heard their share of arguing from both sides."I thought the ejection was too quick, especially being playoff basketball," Clippers guard Lou Williams said. "Everybody knows what Pat brings to the table and the type of competitor that he is. It might have went quick because of the back and forth they had right before that, but I thought it was quick. I think both guys were competing, and that was it."KEEP AN EYE ON: The Warriors blocked 14 shots in Game 1, getting three each by Durant, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala. That was their most all season and tied a franchise playoff high also done on April 27, 1989, at Utah in the first round.COUSINS' NEXT CHANCE: DeMarcus Cousins fouled out of his playoff debut after a nine-year wait, so the big man will be looking to bounce back from a disappointing playoff opener in which he had nine points, nine rebounds and four assists. He returned Jan. 18 against the Clippers after a nearly yearlong absence recovering from a torn left Achilles tendon that required surgery while he was with New Orleans."I don't need to say anything to DeMarcus. It was a frustrating night for him, fouling out, a couple tough calls," coach Steve Kerr said. "But it was important for him to get his feet wet and feel the playoffs, feel the energy, and I have no doubt he'll come back and play a lot better in Game 2."___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressDENVER — DeMar DeRozan scored 18 points and Derrick White had a key steal in the closing seconds in the San Antonio Spurs' 101-96 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday night in Game 1 of their playoff series.White stole the ball at midcourt from Jamal Murray with 1.3 seconds left after LaMarcus Aldridge sank a pair of free throws following his key defensive rebound of Murray's errant shot that would have given the Nuggets a 98-97 lead with seven seconds left.Game 2 is Tuesday night in Denver, where the second-seeded Nuggets failed to parlay the NBA's best home-court record (34-7) into a win against the seventh-seeded but much more seasoned Spurs.San Antonio is making its 22nd straight playoff appearance, this one with a new cast that includes DeRozan, who came over from Toronto in the Kawhi Leonard trade.The Spurs' win marked the third by a road team on the opening day of the NBA playoffs. They joined the Nets, who won at Philadelphia, and Magic, who won at Toronto.The Nuggets, making their first playoff appearance in six years, trailed most of the night. Their last lead came with four minutes left in the first quarter but they trimmed a 12-point deficit to one in the closing minutes.They had the ball with 13 seconds left trailing 97-96 but Murray's shot was off — as it was all night — and Aldridge, who shot just 6 of 19 himself, corralled the rebound, then sank two free throws to make it 99-96 with 6.9 seconds remaining.The Nuggets were hoping for a game-tying 3 although they were just 6 of 28 from long range.They never got the chance, though, as White, a second-year pro who moved into a bigger role when Dejounte Murray got hurt in the preseason, stripped Murray and drew the foul, then sank both shots."He was spectacular," Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. "For somebody who got put in that position and to learn that position with a bunch of new players, it's really remarkable what he's done. Hopefully, he'll continue to play that way because it's going to be a long series."Denver All-Star Nikola Jokic posted the fourth triple-double in Nuggets playoff history, with 10 points, 14 assists and 14 rebounds. But he was hesitant on offense all night, taking just nine shots and making four of them.Throttled by Aldridge, Jokic passed up opportunity after opportunity and shot an airball on a 3-pointer at a crucial moment in the second half that helped San Antonio hold off Denver's surge.)Popovich said it was a wash because Aldridge, who was 6-for-19 for 15 points, really didn't get going, either."We didn't let Jokic play as he wanted and they didn't let LaMarcus play as much as he wanted," Popovich said.White added 16 points for San Antonio and Aldridge and Bryn Forbes each had 15. Reserve Rudy Gay scored 14.Gary Harris led Denver with 20 points and Murray had 17, but that was on 8-of-24 shooting, including 0 for 6 from the arc.The Spurs made 15 of 20 shots in the second quarter to build a 59-51 halftime lead.The Spurs came out cold in the second half and the Nuggets pulled to 62-59. However, Denver missed open 3-pointers on four subsequent possessions with a chance to tie it.The Nuggets are the youngest team in the Western Conference playoffs with an average age just a tad under 25, and only four of them had any playoff experience before Saturday night. So, coach Michael Malone said before tip-off he expected his team to come out a bundle of nerves."This is not rocket science," Malone said. "This is still basketball. And we're going to continue to try to do what we've done at a very high level over the regular season. The biggest factor, the biggest concern will be the initial couple of minutes and trying to get those nerves out. Then I expect we'll be fine after that."They may have settled down but they never really settled in.Asked what adjustments he had in mind for Game 2, Malone said simply, "Make shots."TIP-INS:San Antonio: The Spurs have won five of six playoff series against the Nuggets with their only series defeat coming in 1985. ... The Nuggets held San Antonio to 13 points in the third quarter but managed just 17 themselves.Denver: The Nuggets are 6-21 against the Spurs in the playoffs. ... The Nuggets have lost seven of their last 12 home games against San Antonio. ... Denver won the Northwest Division title for the first time since 2010. ... Denver missed eight free throws.UP NEXTGame 2 is Tuesday night in Denver.______Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Andrew Bogut will start at center for the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors after DeMarcus Cousins tore his quad in the team's loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Monday, head coach Steve Kerr said on Wednesday. The towering Australian, who won a championship with Golden State in 2015, rejoined the team as a backup to Cousins in March after a standout season with the Sydney Kings in Australia's National Basketball League (NBL). "I think Bogut will do a great job. He's been great since he's been back," Kerr told reporters during practice ahead of Thursday's Game Three, which comes after the teams split the first two games of the best-of-seven series."This is why we got him -- just in case. We were hoping we wouldn't have any injuries obviously but that was our most vulnerable position," he said."We're lucky to have Andrew." Last month Bogut, 34, said he was happy to just be along for the ride and would be fine just waving a towel and cheering his team mates from the bench. He will, however, see a lot more action than that now that Cousins is sidelined.Kerr could have started 23-year-old big man Kevon Looney or forward Draymond Green at center but said he was confident in Bogut's abilities. Cousins will not need surgery, according to media reports, to repair the left quad muscle, which he tore while running down a lose ball in the first half of the Warriors 135-131 loss to the Clippers in Oakland.Cousins, who in January made his Warriors debut after a torn Achilles tendon kept him off the court for almost a year, is unlikely to return during the playoffs, where Golden State is chasing a fourth NBA championship in five seasons.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Memphis Grizzlies started the offseason Thursday with plenty of questions to answer, then controlling owner Robert Pera added to the to-do list by firing coach J.B. Bickerstaff as part of a front-office shake-up that demoted general manager Chris Wallace to scout.The Grizzlies announced the moves after both Bickerstaff and Wallace spoke to reporters following a second straight season outside the playoffs. After a 12-5 start, Memphis plummeted and finished 33-49, tied with New Orleans and Dallas.Wallace had said earlier that Bickerstaff would be returning after doing a "terrific job." But Pera didn't agree and restructured the front office a few hours later."In order to put our team on the path to sustainable success, it was necessary to change our approach to basketball operations," Pera said in a statement. "I look forward to a re-energized front office and fresh approach to Memphis Grizzlies basketball under new leadership, while retaining the identity and values that have distinguished our team."Bickerstaff was named interim coach in November 2017 after the Grizzlies fired David Fizdale . He was given the job without the interim title last May. Now Memphis is looking for a fourth head coach since choosing not to renew Lionel Hollins' contract after he led the Grizzlies to their lone Western Conference final appearance in 2013.The Grizzlies also announced that Jason Wexler will be president of the Grizzlies overseeing both basketball and business operations, and Zachary Z. Kleiman replaces John Hollinger as executive vice president of basketball operations with Hollinger moving to an advisory role. The Grizzlies are keeping former player Tayshaun Prince as a special adviser."No words," Grizzlies veteran point guard Mike Conley wrote on Twitter.Memphis began this season with Wallace predicting the Grizzlies would be a playoff team.The Grizzlies wound up trading away center Marc Gasol at the trade deadline. With other trades and injuries that left nine rotation players benched with injuries for Wednesday night's season finale in a 132-117 win over Golden State, Memphis tied its own NBA record for most players used in one season — set last season — again at 28.Memphis also set the NBA mark with 20 different leading scorers, topping the old record of 16 set by the Knicks in 2014-15.While Memphis kept Conley after a frenzy of speculation about his future before the trade deadline, that chatter is about to start again. And Conley, 31, sounds ready to consider his best interest about what happens next with Memphis in full-blown rebuilding mode."I honestly don't think that would be the ideal situation," Conley said. "Ideally, I don't think anybody in my situation would want to go through that again, (since) I don't know how many years I have left."Conley helped his potential value by averaging 24 points and 6.5 assists over his final 16 games. Conley still has two seasons left on the max deal he signed in July 2016,."I'm pretty much getting ready for it, getting ready for that storm ...," Conley said of the coming speculation. "In the last few weeks, it's become more and more like knocking on the door. It's right around the corner. This stuff is going to fire up again. Rumors, all that stuff is going to pop up."Wallace oversaw the signing of Chandler Parsons to a four-year, $94 million deal that has seen the forward play 95 games combined over the first three seasons.The Grizzlies spent much of the season trying to finish outside the top eight spots in the draft to finally pay off a 2015 midseason trade for Jeff Green that still requires a first-round pick to be sent to Boston. The selection is protected if Memphis finished anywhere from No. 1 to 8 in the draft, and the Grizzlies want to fulfill that obligation this June.Memphis wound up in a three-way tie with Dallas and New Orleans for the 7-9 position. Whether the Grizzlies land in the ninth position or with the selection protected won't be known until after the May 14 draft lottery.The next Grizzlies coach will have Jaren Jackson Jr. who showed flashes as the fourth overall draft pick last summer before a deep thigh bruise sidelined him after 58 games. Dillon Brooks also was limited to 18 games by injuries, and Kyle Anderson, signed to a four-year deal last summer, played only 43 games and will have surgery next week on his right shoulder.Jonas Valanciunas, acquired in the February trade for Gasol, has a $17.6 million player option next season.___Advertisement

Lakers owner Jeanie Buss was reportedly ready to OK a departure after previously being fully supportive of Walton."We would like to thank Luke for his dedicated service over the last three years," Pelinka said in a statement. "We wish Luke and his family the best of luck moving forward."Walton compiled a 98-148 record in three seasons as coach. Los Angeles missed the playoffs in all three seasons."I want to thank Jeanie Buss and the Buss family for giving me the opportunity to coach the Lakers," Walton said in a statement. "This franchise and the city will always be special to me and my family."The Lakers went 37-45 this season in a disappointing first campaign of the LeBron James era.Los Angeles was 20-14 when James suffered a groin injury during a Christmas Day win over the Golden State Warriors and the team's fortunes plummeted from there.Walton may not be unemployed for a long period as the Sacramento Kings are reportedly interested in interviewing him for their opening.The Kings went 39-43 this season and fired coach Dave Joerger. They have an impressive young group led by point guard De'Aaron Fox, shooting guard Buddy Hield and power forward Marvin Bagley III.Among the candidates for the Lakers' post is former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue and Philadelphia 76ers assistant coach Monty Williams.Lue coached James for parts of three seasons in Cleveland -- including the franchise's 2016 NBA Finals title -- while Williams coached the New Orleans Pelicans for five seasons.Williams also is reported a candidate for the Sacramento job.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressOAKLAND, Calif. — This is such a different time for the Clippers and Warriors from their days as fierce rivals who swung elbows, tussled and trash-talked at every chance.Both franchises were finding themselves then, from a testy Christmas matchup in 2013 in Oakland to a chippy seven-game first-round series just four months later that was won by Los Angeles.Now, they each are more established — the Warriors a dynasty everyone else in the NBA is desperate to dethrone.Doc Rivers has been a constant for the Clippers. Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson for Golden State."Totally different. They're the young upstarts now, we're the veteran team," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said Friday.The teams are meeting in the first round again. Game 1 in the best-of-seven series is Saturday night at Oracle Arena, where the top-seeded Warriors have home court for the entire postseason — something they didn't have as the Western Conference's No. 2 seed a year ago on the way to a second straight title.During that 2014 playoff series, recordings of then-Clippers owner Donald Sterling surfaced in which he made racist comments, leading to him being banned by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and forced by the league to sell the team."That was the Sterling game. I will never forget that," Rivers said last weekend at Oracle, recalling a 118-97 Game 4 loss. "Unfortunately, I rightly predicted we'd lose by 50, I think we lost by 40 that game, I don't know how much. The distractions were just overwhelming that night. I'll never forget that whole 48 hours."This is definitely a new series, and the Warriors like how they have come together from a topsy-turvy season that featured embarrassing losses at home, a rarity in recent years."I know the historical connotation, we talk about it and we want to chase it and understand how unprecedented it is what we're trying to do," Curry said.Here are some things to watch for in the best-of-seven, first-round series:BEVERLEY'S INFLUENCE: Patrick Beverley missed four games down the stretch and Los Angeles lost all of those. The defensive specialist returned after missing three straight and played 21 minutes in a 143-137 overtime victory against the Jazz in the regular-season finale Wednesday night.The Clippers count heavily on their talented, versatile bench, too.Curry knows he can't let Beverley get under his skin."Just play basketball, that's what we're out on the court to do," Curry said. "Antics and all that kind of stuff is likely to happen, but nothing distracts me from playing basketball."HEALTHY STEPH: Curry wasn't even healthy when the 2018 playoffs began.The two-time MVP returned from a left knee injury for Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinals, missing the entire first round as the Warriors eliminated the Spurs in five games.While he suffered a mild right foot sprain Tuesday at New Orleans, Curry was a full go in practice Friday with no issues. Kerr was committed to not sacrificing the health of his team down the stretch just to secure the No. 1 seed. Now, the Warriors should be well-rested for the playoff opener.COUSINS' CHANCE: DeMarcus Cousins makes his playoff debut after a nine-year wait, and after returning from a devastating injury — he missed nearly a year recovering from surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon suffered last season with New Orleans.Everybody is eager to see Cousins on the big stage at last. That's why he came to the Warriors as a free agent."I have worked my butt off for this opportunity for a long time," Cousins said. "It's unfortunate what happened in New Orleans with the injury and everything. I'm excited for this moment. I plan on taking full advantage of it."Cousins made his season debut at the Clippers on Jan. 18 and he has become a significant contributor on both ends."I just think he fits them better today than the first night that we played them," Rivers said.DUBS ON D: The Warriors have made strides on defense in recent weeks, with the addition of 7-foot Andrew Bogut off the bench a big help even in limited minutes."We've been in these types of series before, where it's about the gamesmanship, understanding players' tendencies," Shaun Livingston said.ORACLE SHINES AGAIN: The Warriors said a ceremonial farewell to Oracle in their final regular-season home game April 7. Now, everybody hopes there are many more postseason games on Golden State's home floor before the franchise moves across the bay to San Francisco and the new Chase Center later this year."Oracle is special," Curry said. "Not to take it for granted what we've been able to do in the past and what we're doing now. Whoever's in the arena is enjoying the excitement of the game. Those mini runs, we feed off their energy."Los Angeles realizes the challenges of winning in such an imposing venue."Probably my favorite place to play so far my rookie year, just because of the atmosphere," Clippers rookie Landry Shamet said.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressCHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Thousands of fans turned out Saturday to celebrate Virginia's first national championship in basketball.The crowd, estimated at 21,000 on the school's Twitter account, filled one side of Scott Stadium five days after the Cavaliers beat Texas Tech 85-77 in overtime to win the title."This is more than we expected," coach Tony Bennett said of the crowd after he and the team emerged from a tunnel to wild cheering.Bennett compared the celebration to one for Clemson's national champion football team during a visit for a basketball game. He said he wondered if he'd ever see the same thing at Virginia."That day is now," he yelled, pumping his fist in the air. The Cavaliers "are part of one of the greatest stories that I've ever seen written and it will be told over and over again," he said.Virginia last year became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed in the NCAA Tournament, and the burden of that loss followed them throughout this season. It heightened during their opening round game in this year's tournament, again as a No. 1 seed, against No. 16 Gardner-Webb. Virginia trailed by as many as 14, but rebounded in the second half and won by 15. Their final three victories in the tournament all were nail-biters."It had been a redemption story for the ages," Dave Koehn, the Cavaliers' play-by-play announcer, told the crowd.Bennett said the team rallied around the idea of "united pursuit" all season."I can't help but think this is a united celebration," he said.Carla Williams, Virginia's athletic director, said she couldn't pick a moment that highlights this year because "I really can't think about this season without thinking about how last year ended."Koehn interviewed the most prominent Cavaliers, and asked junior guard Ty Jerome how he wants to be remembered. Jerome is one of three players considering leaving school early to pursue an NBA career. When Jerome paused after hearing the question, the crowd began chanting "One more year, one more year."The hour-long celebration featured several highlight videos, and before it was over, Virginia redshirt freshman guard Frankie Badocchi played "One Shining Moment" on a keyboard set up on the stage.___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressOrlando had to fight until the final days of the regular season to get its postseason berth. Portland had to scramble down the stretch to replace a huge part of its success.And as is usually the case, San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich had his team playing its best basketball at the end.The Magic, Trail Blazers and Spurs were playoff ready. That's why they're all taking 1-0 series leads into their respective Game 2s on Tuesday night — with Orlando at Toronto, San Antonio at Denver and Portland playing host to Oklahoma City.Orlando and San Antonio, both No. 7 seeds, won on the road and grabbed home-court advantage. But they both know what's coming when Denver and Toronto get fueled by desperation on Tuesday night."It's going to be a lot tougher," Spurs guard DeMar DeRozan said."We're going to get their best," Magic coach Steve Clifford said.It goes without saying that all the teams that are down 1-0 found ways to get better for Game 2. The same goes for the teams leading those series. Clifford has spent two days imploring the Magic to clean up their offense. San Antonio felt it gave Denver too many open looks. Portland won with the help of Oklahoma City missing 28 tries from 3-point range, which likely won't happen again."We played nine players, six of those players it was their first time in the playoffs, their playoff debut," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. "Overall they handled those playoff nerves fairly well."The nerves should be lessened Tuesday.Toronto dropped a Game 1 for the 14th time in 16 playoff series. The Raptors aren't fazed. Kyle Lowry was scoreless in Game 1, but Raptors coach Nick Nurse said defense was the bigger issue for his club."We didn't guard the ball well enough," Nurse said. "And when we didn't guard the ball well enough, we didn't have our second line of help in position. And then we did a poor job of executing some of the game plan portions. Just too many, just strange things I almost can't explain. Somebody would leave a guy and all of a sudden he's standing there wide open. Those things can't happen."Portland, perhaps written off by some when Jusuf Nurkic got hurt late in the season, had a great Game 1 performance from Enes Kanter."He gave us a lot of toughness," Blazers coach Terry Stotts said.A look at Tuesday's games:MAGIC AT RAPTORSMagic lead 1-0. Game 2, 8 p.m. EDT, TNTNEED TO KNOW: Toronto was 32-3 in the regular season when allowing 105 points or less. Magic center Nikola Vucevic had his worst shooting game of the season in Game 1. And Orlando won anyway, 104-101.KEEP AN EYE ON: Kyle Lowry. Much was made of how the Raptors' point guard was scoreless in Game 1. But Toronto outscored Orlando 75-64 when he was on the floor, and was outscored 40-26 when he was on the bench — including a couple of fast-moving, momentum-shifting 9-2 and 10-4 runs by the Magic.INJURY WATCH: Magic guard Michael Carter-Williams is fine after getting hit in the face by Lowry in Game 1.PRESSURE IS ON: Obviously, Raptors coach Nick Nurse. He has this job in large part because his predecessor didn't get it done in the postseason. If Nurse starts 0-2, the 58-win regular season will be fast forgotten.SPURS AT NUGGETSSpurs lead 1-0. Game 2, 9 p.m. EDT, NBA TV.NEED TO KNOW: Denver center Nikola Jokic had the 10th game in NBA playoff history of at least 14 rebounds and 14 assists, and the Nuggets lost anyway. Jokic had the ball plenty in Game 1. The Nuggets need to get him more shots in Game 2; he had only nine in the opener.KEEP AN EYE ON: San Antonio's defense. The Spurs challenged Denver to beat them from the perimeter in Game 1 — and Will Barton, Gary Harris and Jamal Murray shot a combined 21 of 50, 2 for 16 from 3-point range.STAT QUIRK: The Spurs were 1-9 in the regular season when LaMarcus Aldridge shot 33 percent or worse. He shot 6 for 19 in Game 1 (31.6 percent) and the Spurs prevailed.PRESSURE IS ON: The Nuggets in transition. They forced 11 turnovers, eight of them off steals, but turned them into only eight points. If the Spurs are going to make mistakes, they must capitalize better.THUNDER AT TRAIL BLAZERSTrail Blazers lead 1-0. Game 2, 10:30 p.m. EDT, TNT.NEED TO KNOW: Out of the first 2,476 games by teams this season, only 14 shot worse from 3-point range than the Thunder (5-33) did in Game 1. Not surprisingly, all 14 of those teams lost, too.KEEP AN EYE ON: It looks like Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum have had enough with the first-round exits. Neither shot it great in Game 1 — Lillard was 9 for 21, McCollum 9 for 24 — but they were aggressive and set the necessary tone, which is exactly what the Blazers need from their starting guards.INJURY WATCH: It all hinges on Paul George's right shoulder, which he says is fine. "It's well enough now," George said after Oklahoma City practiced Monday. It bears noting that he said that with a large ice pack strapped to his shoulder.PRESSURE IS ON: Russell Westbrook. Starting with when the Thunder took (and eventually wasted) a 3-1 lead against the Warriors in the 2016 Western Conference finals, OKC has lost 12 of its last 15 postseason games.___AP Sports Writer Anne M.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressOAKLAND, Calif. — DeMarcus Cousins shoves off assistant coach Jarron Collins and goes hard for the basket. He swishes a 3-pointer from up top, then hits a jumper inside the arc on the right wing. Cousins drives to the hoop and makes a shot from close range, then a turnaround jumper goes in before he moves to the left side to begin the sequence again.Long before the rest of the Golden State regulars have taken the court for pregame warmups, there is Cousins, earbuds in, meticulously focused on his preparation. In the locker room, he is one of the first to pull on his game jersey.Cousins can't wait for his first playoff chance."It's been a long time coming for him," Collins said. "I definitely think he's excited and he's ready for the moment to play on the biggest stage. Obviously there's a lot that goes into it, the preparation, the dedication."This is why Cousins approached the Warriors last summer and asked for a chance, even though he was working back from season-ending surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon. Cousins joined the two-time defending champions for $5.3 million, a low-risk move for general manager Bob Myers that has worked out beautifully for both sides."I never thought this situation would happen, but it's happened," Cousins said. "This is my team, and anybody that's followed me before this moment, you know how I fight for my team. It's the same thing. Step on them, you're stepping on me."Cousins patiently worked back from a nearly yearlong absence after getting hurt in January 2018 with New Orleans, calling it one of the hardest things he has gone through emotionally and physically in his career. He made his Warriors debut Jan. 18 on the road against the Clippers, showing quickly he would make a big impact on both ends of the floor.The four-time All-Star center's shooting stroke returned in a hurry. For him, finally getting back was largely conditioning and gaining strength in the leg to handle the rigors, pace and low-post pounding of an NBA game again."What does he call it, the Resurgence?" Stephen Curry said. "... We like his fire. In terms of the playoffs, it's going to be amazing, it's his first run, it's going to be good."The 28-year-old Cousins steadily found a groove and more minutes in coach Steve Kerr's rotations. He no longer glares at the coach for taking him out of games."He has been so much fun to coach," Kerr said. "And I wouldn't have said that before he came back when he was rehabbing, he was not that much fun to coach. He would agree with that, he was so frustrated from the injury and from not being able to play and the length of his rehab. Since he returned and since he's grown comfortable with the injury, with the comeback and since his confidence has grown, he's been amazing to coach."He's a fantastic human being, a great teammate. You see his frustration and his passion on the court so people automatically sort of attach labels to him. What I see is passion and emotion because he wants to win."Teammate Shaun Livingston can only imagine what Cousins' first playoffs will mean after a nine-year wait, and after all the hours of rehab. Livingston has lived through the grueling recovery from a major injury like Cousins just endured."We're all going to be excited for him, and he's going to be excited," Livingston said. "I expect him to have a great playoffs because he shows up big in big games."Livingston's left leg could have been amputated 12 years ago, and the knee injury he suffered while with the Clippers in 2007 was so serious nobody knew if he'd walk again let alone play basketball. Going for a layup, Livingston's leg buckled backward, parallel to the court, when he fell in a freak accident.So, he can certainly relate to Cousins' comeback challenges. Livingston offered an encouraging word whenever Cousins seemed to need that boost or encouragement."It's pretty gratifying to see that. ... It feels good to see somebody that, you go through the struggle and then you're able to come back and have success at this level," Livingston said. "Put in a lot of work, more importantly what is fulfilling to see is to see the hard work pay off, because I remember the hard work he's put in, getting to the gym early, getting his routine in. He's put in a lot of work into his body so he could come out and play and perform on the court."Cousins has taken his offensive game to another level, finding a rhythm in Golden State's offense and finding the open teammate with solid ball movement. Before his return, Cousins insisted he understood how things might be in a starting lineup of All-Stars: "It's obvious I won't be taking as many shots as I have in the past," he said.He is dangerous from anywhere, shooting the 3, moving well and drawing defenders to him. One of the NBA's most dominant big men when healthy, he is taking charges on the defensive end and altering shots."I never doubt DeMarcus. He's another guy that's got great pride, great competitor," Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. "He's always just wanted to be a part of a winning team and a winning organization. Now he has that here. He's a guy that he often gets overlooked because of the amount of talent and depth this team."You worry about this team at the 3-point line, well DeMarcus is a guy that in the playoffs you can go to and pound the ball inside into the post, he's going to score, get fouled, or create a double-team and find an open teammate. What a great luxury to have."___Advertisement

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressORLANDO, Fla. — The stars have been stars in these playoffs.Kyrie Irving has Boston on the cusp of sweeping away Indiana Pacers. Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Golden State are coming off a game against the Los Angeles Clippers where the Warriors looked very much like the NBA champions again. Damian Lillard and Russell Westbrook are going at each other big-time in the Portland-Oklahoma City series.And then there's Pascal Siakam.Toronto's surprise story is no surprise anymore.Siakam has been perhaps the biggest breakout player in these playoffs, adding to his breakout season for the Raptors — who lead the Orlando Magic 2-1 in their first-round matchup thanks largely to the 25-year-old from Cameroon and his 24.3 points and 10 rebounds per game in the series.It's easy to forget that Siakam only started playing organized basketball seven years ago."Seriously?" Raptors guard Danny Green asked, unaware of his teammate's unique background.Seriously.Raptors coach Nick Nurse was amused by a recent question suggesting the Siakam was the team's third option offensively behind Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry. Nurse said the way Toronto sees it, Siakam — "Spicy P" is what they call him in Toronto, and the team sent out bottles of hot sauce with his face on the box to NBA awards voters as part of his Most Improved Player campaign — has really been the second option all season.At times in these playoffs, he's been the first option. In other words, a star is being born."Hey, look, he was terrific," Magic coach Steve Clifford said after Siakam's 30-point, 11-rebound effort in Game 3.There's four games on tap Sunday: Boston has a 3-0 lead and can become the first team to advance to the second round if it wins at Indiana. All three other series on the schedule — Golden State at the Los Angeles Clippers, Toronto at Orlando and Portland at Oklahoma City — have the road teams leading 2-1 and in position to all go home for potential closeout wins if they get victories on Sunday.Here's a look at Sunday's games:CELTICS AT PACERSCeltics lead 3-0. Game 4, 1 p.m. EDT, ABCNEED TO KNOW: Boston is seeking its first series sweep since 2011, when it rolled past the Knicks. The Celtics' other 4-0 sweeps came in 1959, 1980, 1981 and 1986. The Pacers are trying to avoid a fourth straight first-round exit and their second 4-0 loss in three years.KEEP AN EYE ON: Pacers starting forwards Bojan Bogdanovic and Thaddeus Young will be free agents this summer. Might this be their finales in Indiana?INJURY WATCH: Pacers star Victor Oladipo, out since January with a right knee injury, is expected to be at Game 4. He was going to fly in for Game 3, but was delayed by weather.PRESSURE IS ON: Boston. There's no pressure on Indiana; no one has come from 3-0 down to win a series, so the Pacers won't be expected to change that. Boston is playing for more rest before facing the Milwaukee-Detroit winner.WARRIORS AT CLIPPERSWarriors lead 2-1. Game 4, 3:30 p.m. EDT, ABCNEED TO KNOW: Golden State sent a very clear message in Game 3, blowing out Los Angeles by 27 with only one starter logging more than 30 minutes. And the Clippers have allowed a staggering 129.7 points in their last six games (going 2-4).KEEP AN EYE ON: The Clippers' first unit. Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell are great off the bench and play starters' minutes, so this is somewhat misleading, but Doc Rivers can't have just one starter in double figures — as was the case in Game 2.INJURY WATCH: Andrew Bogut had eight points, 14 rebounds and five assists in his first game as DeMarcus Cousins' replacement for the Warriors.PRESSURE IS ON: Patrick Beverley. The Clippers' point guard is unquestionably tough, but four fouls and five shots in 18 minutes — like he had in Game 3 on Thursday — won't cut it again.RAPTORS AT MAGICRaptors lead 2-1. Game 4, 7 p.m. EDT, TNTNEED TO KNOW: Entering Saturday, three players in these playoffs — Stephen Curry, James Harden and Pascal Siakam — had a 30-point double-double. Curry and Harden made a combined $68 million this season. Siakam made about $1.5 million.KEEP AN EYE ON: Orlando guard Evan Fournier is 12 for 42 in this series and was 1 for 12 in Game 3. Among players with at least 10 shot attempts, there's been only five instances in Magic history where someone shot worse in a home game.INJURY WATCH: Bad news for Orlando: Toronto's Kawhi Leonard was ailing for Game 3 with an illness, which may explain some of his 6-for-19 shooting effort. He's expected to feel better Sunday.PRESSURE IS ON: Orlando's starters. Toronto opened on an 11-0 run (and 16-2) in Game 2 and a 10-0 run in Game 3. Another occurrence of that in Game 4 would be trouble.TRAIL BLAZERS AT THUNDERTrail Blazers lead 2-1. Game 4, 9:30 p.m. EDT, TNTNEED TO KNOW: Oklahoma City clearly got its swagger back in Game 3. And Portland needs to buck this history: The Trail Blazers are 0-7 in their last seven playoff games immediately following a loss.KEEP AN EYE ON: The Damian Lillard-Russell Westbrook matchup is the premier head-to-head tussle so far in these playoffs. Lillard's 25-point third quarter in Game 3 was phenomenal, but the Thunder held him to seven points in the other three quarters.INJURY WATCH: Thunder forward Paul George struggled with his shot again in Game 3 — a season-worst 3 for 16, raising questions about his troublesome right shoulder. But he got to the line 17 times, making 14, so he's clearly not shying from contact.PRESSURE IS ON: Portland's defense. Trail Blazer fouls sent the Thunder on the foul line 39 times in Game 3.___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThe Golden State Warriors are trying to regain the lead in a series they probably still can't believe is tied.Same with the San Antonio Spurs, who like the Warriors know they are facing an opponent who won't stay down no matter how far they fall down.The Clippers' historic comeback against the Warriors, followed by Denver's potential season-saving surge against the Spurs, made that clear.So things are all even in those two Western Conference first-round series, which resume with a pair of Game 3s on Thursday night.Philadelphia and Brooklyn play the other Game 3 of the night in an East series that also is tied at a game apiece.Golden State would be up 2-0 if not for the Clippers' colossal comeback — or the Warriors' colossal collapse — on Monday night in Game 2. The Warriors led by 31 in the third quarter before Los Angeles charged back to win 135-131 after the biggest rally in NBA postseason history.The Warriors won Game 1 by 17, appeared headed toward an even easier win in Game 2, and yet go into Game 3 basically starting from scratch."If you were up 30 with a quarter and a half to go, you just lose out of nowhere, it's like somebody ran up to you and punched you in the guy and ran away," Kevin Durant said. "It's shock. I don't even know how to explain it."The seventh-seeded Spurs took the series opener against a Denver team that was an NBA-best 34-7 at home during the regular season. San Antonio then was up 78-59 late in the third quarter of Game 2 before Jamal Murray's 21-point fourth quarter carried the Nuggets to a 114-105 victory.At least the Spurs, unlike the Warriors, can regroup in their home building, where the Nuggets haven't won since 2012."It's definitely not ideal to have a lead and then blow it like that," Spurs forward LaMarcus Aldridge said. "We came in and definitely played a pretty good first half, but you know when you come on the road in the playoffs and you win one game on the road, that's great. So we've got to go home and try to take care of business."A look at Thursday's games:76ERS AT NETSTied 1-1. Game 3, 8 p.m. EDT, TNTNEED TO KNOW: After dropping the opener and leading by only one at halftime of Game 2, the 76ers finally looked like favorites by pouring in 51 points in the third quarter to roll to a 145-123 victory. Now they go to the home of the Nets, who have won Game 3 in their last three playoff series dating to the first round in 2014.KEEP AN EYE ON: Joel Embiid. Even limited by knee soreness, he has double-doubles in both games to give him nine in his first 10 postseason games. Only Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Oscar Robertson had more.INJURY WATCH: The Nets are listing veteran forward Jared Dudley as probable. His defense played a key role in the opener but he missed Game 2 with right calf tightness.PRESSURE IS ON: Brooklyn's starters. The bench helped carry the Nets after a slow start in Game 1, but the hole was too big to climb after the dismal beginning to the second half of Game 2.NUGGETS AT SPURSSeries tied at 1. Game 3, 9 p.m. EDT, NBATVNEED TO KNOW: With their Game 2 win, the Nuggets snapped a five-game skid to the Spurs in the playoffs that dated to 2007. They couldn't afford to fall 2-0 given the Nuggets have dropped 13 straight in San Antonio.KEEP AN EYE ON: Gary Harris. Sure, Murray scored 21 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, and big man Nikola Jokic just missed his second triple-double of the series, but Harris chipped in 23. He flies under the radar.PRESSURE IS ON: Aldridge and DeMar DeRozan. The tandem combined 55 points, but may need to take their game to an even higher level — if that's possible. "We had control of the game. We just let the fourth quarter get away," Aldridge said. "We didn't execute defensively as well as we had the other three quarters and we let those guys get going a little bit."WARRIORS AT CLIPPERSTied 1-1. Game 3, 10:30 p.m. EDT, TNTNEED TO KNOW: Lou Williams, the favorite for Sixth Man of the Year, is averaging 30.5 points and 10 assists in the series. Fellow reserve Montrezl Harrell has scored 25.5 points on 20-of-24 shooting.KEEP AN EYE ON: Durant and Patrick Beverley. Beverley's antics in defending the 6-foot-9 Durant are fun to watch, and having some success. Durant took only eight shots in Game 2 and coach Steve Kerr wants him to be more aggressive."The guy is the most skilled basketball player on planet earth," Kerr said. "There's nobody who can do what he can do. It's the playoffs. Defenses are more locked in, they're playing everybody tougher. I don't know how many shots he got the other night, seven, eight. Absolutely he needs to be more aggressive. It's the playoffs. He can get any shot he wants any time. I want to see him get 20 shots, 30."INJURY WATCH: With DeMarcus Cousins lost to a torn left quadriceps muscle, Andrew Bogut will step in to start for the two-time defending champions. He re-signed last month for a second stint with the franchise after playing for the 2015 champions and the '16 team that won 73 games before losing to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in Game 7 of the finals."This is why we got him, just in case," Kerr said.In addition, Kevon Looney will see increased minutes. He scored a career-high 19 points on 6-for-6 shooting in Game 1 filling in for Cousins, who won't require surgery for the injury. The big man returned in January from a nearly yearlong absence recovering from surgery for a torn left Achilles tendon.PRESSURE IS ON: Golden State's defense. The Warriors allowed 85 points in the second half of Game 2, too much even for their potent offense to overcome.___AP Sports Writers Pat Graham in Denver, Colorado and Janie McCauley in Oakland, California contributed to this report.Advertisement

Buddy Hield also missed a late 3-pointer for the Kings.Hield finished with 12 points and made two 3s, giving him 599 in his first three NBA seasons.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — The first big stop for James Dolan's plane will be to pick up Patrick Ewing, if the Hall of Famer wants a lift to Chicago to represent the Knicks at the draft lottery.Maybe later it could fly Kevin Durant and another superstar to New York.With the right mix of lottery luck and summer shopping, the Knicks know the chance is there to quickly improve what was the NBA's worst record this season."We're excited," Knicks President Steve Mills said Wednesday, "and we're not going to hide that we're excited and we're optimistic about what we hope the summer leads to."But, he added, the Knicks are also realistic. They've created the financial flexibility to give themselves the possibility to sign or trade for All-Star players this summer, but there are no guarantees of getting anyone. Especially because Mills said the Knicks would only target players who are on board with the way they want to build a team that can compete for a championship and not just a playoff spot.First, the Knicks go into the May 14 lottery with a 14% chance of landing the No. 1 pick after finishing with a 17-65 record that matched the worst in franchise history.It was Dolan, the Madison Square Garden chairman and Knicks owner, who called Mills with the idea of having Ewing represent the team on stage. Ewing was the prize when the Knicks won the first lottery in 1985, and he accepted the Knicks' offer once he knew it wouldn't interfere with his recruiting schedule as Georgetown coach.Under the league's new lottery rules, the team with the worst record could tumble all the way to the No. 5 pick."Our job is to prepare for every possible scenario," general manager Scott Perry said. "So we know going into this draft we can either end up with 1, best-case scenario, 5, quote-unquote worst-case scenario, and we work all year long to be very prepared to tackle either scenario. And we'll be comfortable doing so."Perry added it was too soon to even discuss whether the Knicks would consider trading the pick, wherever it falls.No matter who the Knicks get during the offseason, they will need to determine who they want back from a team that was full of players who will become free agents. Mills said every player they met with after the season expressed an interest in returning in 2019-20.He, Perry and coach David Fizdale responded to that with honest talk about the possibilities."We tell the guys, 'This is what you did great, this is what you need to improve on. Assuming you get better at these things, we'd love to have you back as part of our group, depending on what happens with the draft, depending on what happens with free agency and also depending on what the business of this league looks like,'" Mills said."We've had a lot of guys that improved in games over the course of this season and they may be in a position that no matter what we do, we may not have enough money to pay what they're going to get paid from someone else."There would be even less money left if the Knicks are able to sign two maximum salary players. Rounding out a roster to complement them would be challenging."That would be a good problem to have and to figure out," Perry said.______Advertisement

Nikita Kucherov, who led the NHL with 128 points this season, was held pointless and had just three shots on goal.Kucherov's frustration was apparent, as he was assessed a minor penalty for tripping, a major penalty for boarding and a game misconduct for an incident involving Columbus' Markus Nutivaara with 4:26 remaining.The Lightning star will have a hearing Saturday with the NHL's department of player safety to discuss that hit. Per the NHL, boarding is the grounds on which the league is considering additional discipline -- which could include a suspension.Islanders 3, Penguins 1Jordan Eberle and Josh Bailey scored fewer than four minutes apart in the third period of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals for New York, which beat Pittsburgh in Uniondale, N.Y.The Islanders, who have home-ice advantage for the first time since 1988, hold a 2-0 series lead for the first time since they swept the Edmonton Oilers in the 1983 Stanley Cup. Among NHL, NBA and MLB teams, only baseball's Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals and Pittsburgh Pirates have gone longer without holding a 2-0 series lead.The Penguins are down 0-2 in a series for the first time since being swept by the Boston Bruins in the 2013 Eastern Conference finals.Blues 4, Jets 3Ryan O'Reilly's early-third-period goal was the game-winner as visiting St. Louis beat Winnipeg to claim both road games in the Manitoba capital and stake a 2-0 lead in their opening-round Western Conference playoff series.With the score tied in the third period in a back-and-forth affair, O'Reilly raced up the ice and used the defenseman as a screen when he shot from the right faceoff dot and hit the mark on the stick side at the 3:46 mark of the final frame. Taking a lead for the third time was the charm for the Blues.Oskar Sundqvist scored twice for St. Louis, which also got a goal from Patrick Maroon. Patrik Laine, Mark Scheifele and Blake Wheeler scored for Winnipeg.Knights 5, Sharks 3Max Pacioretty had a goal and an assist, and William Karlsson and Colin Miller each scored short-handed goals to lead Vegas past host San Jose to even their first-round Western Conference playoff series at 1-1.Mark Stone and Cody Eakin also scored goals, and Paul Stastny added two assists for Vegas.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMIAMI — A flight was awaiting Miami Heat President Pat Riley on Saturday, just as he hoped.It just wasn't to Toronto or Milwaukee for Game 1 of a playoff series. That's the problem.Riley's second home in Malibu, California, is one of his happy places — though with the NBA playoffs starting this weekend, Malibu is about the last place he wants be right now. The playoffs aren't on Riley's calendar this season, so he's taking 10 blue notebooks to Malibu and plans to fill them with ideas on how to make sure that's not the case in 2020."I'm going to write and write and write and write," Riley said. "That's where we are for the next couple of weeks. Once the hangover subsides, then we'll have more coherent thought."A challenging offseason awaits the Heat, who went 39-43 this season and will return for training camp in about five months without Dwyane Wade — probably their best player this season, and at times certainly their most important player. Wade is retiring, and if the Heat have plans to remake their roster before next season they'll likely need some willing trade partners to make things happen.Miami already has players signed to about $140 million worth of deals for next season. Flexibility is not something Riley figures to have much of when its time to wheel and deal on the trade and free-agent markets."Very, very disappointed. I'm disappointed in myself. Obviously," Riley said Saturday, as he sat alone on a stage set up on the Heat practice court — one that figures to not be in much use for the next couple weeks while players rest and recover. "This has not come together the way that I thought it would. I thought this year that we would be in the top half of the Eastern Conference."The Heat finished 10th in the East. They beat 13 of the 16 playoff-bound teams — the only ones who swept Miami were Denver (2-0), Indiana (3-0) and Toronto (4-0). But the Heat also lost at least once to nine of the 13 other teams that didn't make the playoffs — going 1-3 against Atlanta, plus 0-2 against the Los Angeles Lakers, Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves."There's going to be changes next year," Riley said. "Not a new culture, but tightening the screws on a culture that sometimes erodes just a little bit."Riley said the team is a long way from personnel decisions and draft strategy. The Heat want Dion Waiters slimmer and believe his game would explode if he got into world-class condition. They're still — in what seems like an annual occurrence now — figuring out how best to use Hassan Whiteside, who has a $27.1 million player option for next season. They believe James Johnson will be better. They hope Udonis Haslem returns for a 17th season.But one thing that Riley knows must change is the home record. Miami was awful at home this year, going 19-22. Only five teams were worse, and Riley was bothered by the Heat penchant for getting big leads and then letting them slip away."The last thing I want to do is send our fans into the beautiful night of Miami, cheering like crazy in the first half with a 20-point lead and leaving with a one-point loss," Riley said.Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressLOS ANGELES — Zion Williamson of Duke insisted he doesn't know if he's going to declare for the NBA draft and leave Duke early.Then his words seemingly betrayed him.After winning the John R. Wooden Award as the nation's outstanding men's player at the College Basketball Awards Friday night, he rattled off memories from his freshman year."Just being around each other on and off the court because it was more than basketball," Williamson said during the nationally televised show. "The brotherhood is something real. The bond we had built is second to none so I know I'm going to miss that."Oops.Asked for the second time on the show if he was leaving early, he replied, "Like I said before, I don't know."Williamson is the sixth player from Duke to win the award named for the late UCLA coach, who won a record 10 NCAA championships.Williamson's trophy cabinet is already overstuffed. He has collected numerous awards — including The Associated Press player of the year — for his efforts in leading the Blue Devils to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament. They lost 68-67 to Michigan State, denying themselves a trip to the Final Four.Earlier, Williamson won the Karl Malone power forward trophy."I don't regret nothing about this season," he said. "I enjoyed every moment of it."Sabrina Ionescu of Oregon was a surprise winner of the women's Wooden Award. She and Williamson shared the spotlight during the fifth annual ceremony at The Novo in downtown Los Angeles.Her mouth dropped open when her name was announced. The NCAA Division I leader in career triple-doubles with 18, she led the Ducks on their first-ever Final Four run. The 21-year-old point guard plans to return for her senior year."This award isn't won alone, so this goes out to my team, my family, my coaches, and everyone that made this possible," Ionescu said. "Growing up with two brothers, it wasn't easy. They never took it easy on me. We fought all the time. We played in the yard, and so this goes to them. They pushed me to my limits all the time."Ionescu beat out Connecticut's Napheesa Collier, Asia Durr of Louisville, Iowa's Megan Gustafson and Teaira McCowan of Mississippi State.Gustafson had earned several postseason honors, including AP player of the year for leading the nation in scoring for the second straight season.Other winners were:— RJ Barrett of Duke, Jerry West shooting guard award— Rui Hachimura of Gonzaga, Julius Erving small forward award— Ethan Happ of Wisconsin, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar center award— Ja Morant of Murray State, Bob Cousy point guard awardAll of the award namesakes were on hand to present their trophies except Cousy, who is 90.Oklahoma coach Lon Kruger received the Wooden Legends of Coaching award from Steve Henson, his former player at Kansas State and current Texas-San Antonio coach.Kruger is 160-105 in eight seasons with the Sooners. He's the first Division I coach to guide five different schools to the NCAA Tournament.The individual awards were decided by a combination of fan votes and input from the Basketball Hall of Fame's selection committee.___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSACRAMENTO, Calif. — Sacramento's best season in 13 years wasn't enough to save coach Dave Joerger's job.General manager Vlade Divac fired Joerger on Thursday after he helped develop the young Kings into playoff contenders before ultimately falling short in the franchise's 13th straight losing season."I think he did a great job to make that step," Divac said. "But moving forward, I just felt like we had to go a different direction. It's been three years and we made some progress. This year was a good season but I think we could do more, especially after All-Star break."Divac said he had been contemplating the decision to change coaches for a while and ultimately made it after the team stumbled to the finish with a 9-16 record after the All-Star break. The poor stretch run left Sacramento with a 39-43 record, nine games out of a playoff spot after being tied for the eighth spot in the West heading into the final game before the break.The Kings had their most wins since having a 44-38 record in coach Rick Adelman's final season in 2005-06. That ended a run of eight straight playoff berths and Sacramento hasn't been back to the postseason since for the NBA's longest active drought."After the All-Star break, I felt very confident we'd be in the race and we were in the race," Divac said. "Unfortunately, we fell short."Divac made the move official just hours after he was given an extension through the 2022-23 season by owner Vivek Ranadivé. Divac took over as GM before the 2015-16 season and helped bring in some of the key pieces that have led to the improvement this year, including guards Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox and big men Marvin Bagley III, Willie Cauley-Stein and Harry Giles.Divac also made a trade this season to acquire forward Harrison Barnes from Dallas in hopes of making a playoff push but the team faltered down the stretch."Vlade has been vital to what we are building here and I am so pleased to announce his extension," Ranadivé said. "Throughout his entire career, Vlade is someone who has always made those around him better, both on and off the court. I look forward to our bright future ahead."Joerger was the ninth coach since Adelman was fired in 2006 with none able to post a winning record or a playoff berth. In fact, since moving to Sacramento before the 1985-86 season, the only winning seasons for the Kings came in Adelman's eight seasons at the helm highlighted by a trip to the Western Conference final in 2002.Divac is now counting on coach No. 10 being the one that can get the team back to the level it had under Adelman, when the Kings were a contender for several years and played an entertaining brand of basketball."The next level is to be a team that is going to be a playoff team and down the road a contender," Divac said. "I think our kids are very talented. We have to believe in them and give them a chance to take advantage of their work and talent."___Advertisement

The poor stretch run left Sacramento with a 39-43 record, nine games out of a playoff spot after being tied for the eighth spot in the West heading into the final game before the break.The Kings had their most wins since having a 44-38 record in coach Rick Adelman's final season in 2005-06. That ended a run of eight straight playoff berths and Sacramento hasn't been back to the postseason since for the NBA's longest active drought."After the All-Star break, I felt very confident we'd be in the race and we were in the race," Divac said. "Unfortunately, we fell short."Divac made the move official just hours after he was given an extension through the 2022-23 season by owner Vivek Ranadivé. Divac took over as GM before the 2015-16 season and helped bring in some of the key pieces that have led to the improvement this year, including guards Buddy Hield and De'Aaron Fox and big men Marvin Bagley III, Willie Cauley-Stein and Harry Giles.Divac also made a trade this season to acquire forward Harrison Barnes from Dallas in hopes of making a playoff push but the team faltered down the stretch."Vlade has been vital to what we are building here and I am so pleased to announce his extension," Ranadivé said. "Throughout his entire career, Vlade is someone who has always made those around him better, both on and off the court. I look forward to our bright future ahead."Joerger was the ninth coach since Adelman was fired in 2006 with none able to post a winning record or a playoff berth. In fact, since moving to Sacramento before the 1985-86 season, the only winning seasons for the Kings came in Adelman's eight seasons at the helm highlighted by a trip to the Western Conference final in 2002.Divac is now counting on coach No. 10 being the one that can get the team back to the level it had under Adelman, when the Kings were a contender for several years and played an entertaining brand of basketball."The next level is to be a team that is going to be a playoff team and down the road a contender," Divac said. "I think our kids are very talented. We have to believe in them and give them a chance to take advantage of their work and talent."___Advertisement

Team president Ernie Grunfeld was fired last week after 16 years in charge.John Wall and Dwight Howard both missed most of the season with injuries.Beal, a two-time All-Star, finished with 16 points, five rebounds and four assists — all before halftime — on Tuesday as he played in all 82 games for the second consecutive season.The Celtics already were assured of finishing as the No. 4 team in the Eastern Conference and facing the No. 5-seeded Indiana Pacers in the first round of the playoffs. They finished 49-33.So there was no reason for Boston to care about the outcome Tuesday — or, therefore, use any of its best players.Seven prominent members of the roster were ruled out: Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Marcus Smart, Aron Baynes and Marcus Morris. That group includes six of the top seven Celtics in scoring and assists, the club's six leading rebounders.The starting lineup was Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier, Semi Ojeleye, Guerschon Yabusele and Robert Williams. Ojele, Yabusele and Williams had a combined three starts this season before Tuesday.TIP-INSCeltics: Rozier scored 21 points. ... Signed G Jonathan Gibson. He played four games for Boston last season. "He gets buckets," coach Brad Stevens said.Wizards: Tomas Satoransky scored 19 points. ... Signed Gs Jordan McRae and Tarik Phillip. McRae was on a two-way contract this season, when he averaged 5.9 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 27 games for the Wizards and led the NBA G League in scoring at 30.4 ppg for the Capital City Go-Go. Phillip played for the Memphis Hustle in the G League.WALL SPEAKSWizards PG Wall says he is not sure whether he will be able to play next season as he recovers from a torn Achilles tendon. "I have no idea just yet," Wall told reporters at halftime. "That's my goal."STEVENS ON VIRGINIA, BENNETTStevens, who led Butler to two runner-up finishes in the NCAA Tournament, was asked for his reaction to seeing coach Tony Bennett and Virginia go from last year's disaster — the first No. 1 seed to lose to a 16 — to this year's championship. "One of the coolest things I think I've seen in sports was Tony Bennett's reaction when they got beat last year and the way that he handled it," Stevens said. "And then to back that up with the year they had ... and for all those kids and for him and for everybody associated with the program to win all those games in the fashion that they did. ... Tony is a good friend and I am thrilled for him and for college basketball. I think he's about all the good stuff."UP NEXT:Celtics: Game 1 of their first-round series against the Pacers will be in Boston; day and time to be announced.Wizards: Season over.

AdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLOS ANGELES — When Kevin Durant rained down shots on the Los Angeles Clippers with his deadly playoff performance on Thursday, he also provided a glimpse of what life will be like for Golden State and their competition without the injured DeMarcus Cousins.In short, less Cousins will equal more Durant -- more Durant post-ups, more Durant pull-ups and more Durant brilliance.The Clippers learned the hard way as Durant hung 38 points on them in a 132-105 rout that gave the Warriors a 2-1 best-of-seven first-round series lead.      “DeMarcus started playing for us late in the season and we definitely wanted to establish him in the post a lot to start games,” Durant told Reuters, following his dominant night. “Without him in the lineup, coach just used me in his spots.”When Cousins suffered a quad injury on Monday that sidelined him indefinitely, it was viewed as a potential roadblock to the team’s quest for a third straight title.Instead, the absence may have unlocked a version of Durant that has led to the past two championships and back-to-back Finals MVPs. Golden State fed their lanky sharpshooter early on Thursday, and Durant repaid them by making his first six attempts on an array of moves.For the game, he finished 14-for-23 from the field and added seven assists. “We said before the game they were going to post (Durant) more,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers told reporters. “Instead of having him at the elbows, they’re going to bring him to the right box and he’s going to score from there most likely.“They did that, and he made shots.”      EXTRA INCENTIVEDurant had extra incentive to be aggressive in Game Three after his manufactured feud with Clippers guard Patrick Beverley had dominated headlines.Durant and Beverley were each ejected for jawing at each other in Golden State’s Game One win. The Warriors All Star attempted just eight shots in Game Two where Beverley guarded him closely and the Clippers overcame a 31-point deficit to prevail.All the superfluous talk surrounding Durant, about Beverley, his pending free agency or his technical foul total, seemed to obscure his most defining gift -- scoring.“He’s a top-three player in this league,” Clippers guard Lou Williams said. “He plays at a high level, we expected that. He’s capable of making shots.”Durant had been making, and taking, less of them recently, though. His shot attempt average has fallen each month since February, and his latest 38-point game was his highest total in more than two months.The two-time NBA scoring champion bristled at the idea that he was ever passive.“I don’t run the show on any team I’ve ever been a part of, I’m just a player - one of the guys,” Durant said. “So, whatever the coach asks me to do I have to be prepared for it. I don’t pass up shots, I just play within the offense”Golden State’s new playoff offense is set to look a lot like its old one – with Durant at the forefront. His team mates are prepared to feed off of his potency.“He came out super aggressive and in kill mode (Thursday). That was all the difference for us,” Golden State forward Draymond Green said.“How many people can stop Kevin if Kevin don’t want to be stopped?”The Warriors and their opponents are about to find out.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMETAIRIE, La. — The Pelicans newly hired top basketball executive said he's keeping coach Alvin Gentry and wouldn't rule out the possibility of talking six-time All-Star Anthony Davis into rescinding his trade request and committing to New Orleans long-term."We have a very long and successful history together with Klutch Sports," Pelicans executive vice president of basketball operations David Griffin said Wednesday, referring to the agency, led by Rich Paul, that represents Davis. "Rich Paul and I have spoken about Anthony and I think we're both excited about what we can potentially build here."Griffin was Cleveland's general manager when LeBron James — who also is represented by Paul — was with the Cavaliers and led them to the franchise's only NBA title.Davis, who is under contract with the Pelicans for one more season, requested a trade in late January. In the aftermath, the Pelicans fired general manager Dell Demps, who has been effectively replaced by Griffin, albeit under a different title.The Pelicans hired Griffin on Friday and formally introduced him on Wednesday.Griffin said he has not yet met with Davis, but disputed the notion that Davis' situation in New Orleans became too toxic to salvage."Quite the opposite, actually," Griffin said. "Rich is genuinely excited about this situation. Rich represents the greatest player of his generation and he saw LeBron buy into what we were doing and our direction (in Cleveland) and the respect he had for what we did."Pelicans owner Gayle Benson said she liked Griffin's outlook on Davis."We certainly don't want somebody here whose heart isn't in it, but hopefully Anthony will have a change of heart and if he does, we'll welcome him back with open arms," Benson said. "We'd like for him to stay if everybody agrees to it."Even if Davis doesn't say, it is arguably in the Pelicans' interest to attempt to keep him, if only to create more urgency on the part of prospective trade partners.Meanwhile, Griffin also called the retention of Gentry a "no-brainer." The two worked together in Phoenix, when Gentry coached the Suns to the Western Conference finals.Griffin went so far as to call Gentry's presence as head coach "one of big, big factors in this decision for me.""My leadership style is to build a family — a family that loves each other enough to tell each other what they need to hear. Alvin and I can do that for each other," Griffin said. "Having a partner in this process gives us an enormous leg up."Griffin added that when he worked with Gentry in Phoenix, "Alvin was really honest about the fact that he's at his best when he's fearless Alvin — when he's not looking over his shoulder, when he's not feeling like he has to do everything by himself. And I think we can put him a space to be the best of his angels."Benson noted that every candidate interviewed for the job eventually given to Griffin said they would be inclined to reatain Gentry, who she credited for doing an "incredible job under very challenging times" this season."He just needs to get the right players together," Benson said later. "We've had some bad breaks."Griffin was among a half-dozen candidates who interviewed to become New Orleans top basketball operations executive in recent weeks, including interim general manager Danny Ferry.He said Benson convinced him of her commitment to winning by agreeing to what Griffin described as "outrageous demands" related to his desire to bolster staffing and resources in the front office.___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressMINNEAPOLIS — The buzzer sounded and Tom Izzo walked stoically across the Final Four floor to shake hands with Texas Tech counterpart Chris Beard, no doubt complimenting him on a fine defensive performance.It's a walk Izzo has made a lot over the past two decades.Frustrated all night by the Red Raiders' stingy defense, and unable to get guards Cassius Winston and Matt McQuaid into much rhythm, Michigan State fell once again on college basketball's grandest stage. The Spartans' 61-51 defeat in the national semifinals Saturday night was their sixth straight trip to the tournament's final weekend without hoisting a championship trophy.It also continued a maddening run of disappointment for the Big Ten, which hasn't had a national champion since Mateen Cleaves and the Spartans won Izzo's only title in 2000.The Spartans certainly had their chances Saturday night.They trailed just 23-21 at halftime in the kind of defensive slugfest everyone anticipated, and it was still a nip-and-tuck game early in the second half. And even when the Red Raiders pushed the lead to 48-35 — their biggest of the game — the Spartans never quite seemed out of it.The Big Ten's regular-season and tournament champions kept pecking away, including a series of free throws that nipped into Texas Tech's lead. When Aaron Henry followed two foul shots of his own with a big basket with 2:51 left, the deficit was down to 52-51 and the green-clad fans were stirring.That was the closest the Spartans got down the stretch.Jarrett Culver answered with a scooping layup for the Red Raiders, and Winston committed a silly offensive foul at the other end to give the ball back. McQuaid missed a wide open 3-pointer on Michigan State's next trip down floor, and Culver added a free throw to extend the Red Raiders' lead.The Spartans' last chance to make it close ended when Xavier Tillman was stripped by Texas Tech big man Norense Odiase with 1:19 to go, and the Red Raiders efficiently put the game away.Izzo shook Beard's hand as the Red Raiders set their sights on Virginia in the final.The defeats Michigan State has endured in the Final Four over the years have come in all flavors: They've fallen as high seeds expected to do great things and low seeds that surpassed expectations, and run into buzz-saws such as Duke and Arizona that were loaded with future NBA prospects and dropped down-to-the-wire nail-biters to the likes of Gordon Hayward and Butler.On Saturday night, they lost to a team that beat them at their own game.Izzo prides himself on toughness — in the old days, he'd suit up his guys in shoulder pads and helmets in practice. Yet the Red Raiders beat Michigan State to the punch all night, harassing Sparty on the perimeter and rendering Tillman and fellow forward Kenny Goins ineffective in the paint.Michigan State wound up shooting 32 percent from the field, went 7 of 24 from the 3-point arc and desperately could have used Joshua Langford, their forward they lost to a season-ending injury.Winston, who played all 40 minutes, tried to rescue the Spartans in the second half. The Big Ten player of the year wound up with 16 points but he needed 16 shots to get there.Nobody else gave him much help, either.The result was a national championship appearance for Texas Tech in its first trip to the Final Four, and another weekend that ended in disappointment for Izzo and the Spartans.___Advertisement

Yes, George is averaging 26.5 points in their first-round playoff series, but he's making just 27 percent of his 3-pointers — down from 39 percent during the regular season.Much has been made of his shoulder issues, which he has been dealing with the past few months. George even missed the regular-season finale against Milwaukee after not being able to lift his arm.But George said Thursday his shoulder is not the issue, noting that he is pain-free."The first game it was just out of rhythm, trying to find shots," George said. "The second game, it was just knowing where shots were going to come from, knowing the space that I could get playing at the basket and taking advantage of where I can get to the rim. It'll be a great mix Game 3."The Thunder hope it is a great mix. They're down 0-2 as the series shifts to Oklahoma City Friday night.In Game 1 against Portland, he went 8 for 24 from the field and made 4 of 15 3-pointers. In Game 2, George focused more on drives and shorter jumpers and was a more efficient 11 for 20 from the floor.The Thunder desperately need George's long-range production. He led the team and ranked fourth in the NBA with 3.8 makes per game in the regular season. Oklahoma City has made just 10 of 61 3-pointers in the series. George has made six of 22, meaning his teammates have missed 35 of their 39 tries.George averaged a career-best 28.0 points per game this season — second in the league behind James Harden.When George is on, he takes point guard Russell Westbrook out of do-everything mode. Westbrook shot 5 for 20 while trying to pick up for his team's struggles in Game 2.Despite their struggles, George said neither his approach nor the team's approach will change."We have to keep shooting," he said. "We're going to make shots. Keep shooting. We miss shots, so what. Keep shooting."Portland was concerned with the 3-point opportunities George had in Game 1 and adjusted. George responded by making 9 of 13 shots inside the 3-point line in Game 2. He only took seven threes though— down from his season average of 9.8 attempts."I thought by far, in the first game, he had a lot of really, really good open 3-point shots," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. "I think in the second game, they tried to take a lot of those away. I think he played down low a little bit more, played at the rim. When he could get into some space where he could kind of use his dribbling to create some gaps for himself, he drove or he stepped back and shot it from mid-range."George said the shoulder problems have not affected him defensively. The league leader in steals during the regular season often matches up with an opponent's best wing player, but he hasn't been matched up with Damian Lillard or C.J. McCollum much in the series. He said that's by design because he's supporting Westbrook and Terrance Ferguson by clogging the lane.Still, the Thunder's biggest problems in the series have been on offense. George said getting back to Oklahoma City could help — but just being in OKC isn't enough."We'll get back on stride being at home," he said. "I'm not going to say that just to say that just because we're going to be at home, it's going to be all fine and dandy. We've got to come out and play, execute, do the things that we do to win this game."______Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressOAKLAND, Calif. — Stephen Curry's pregame tunnel heaves have become such a spectacle at Oracle Arena that hundreds of cameras rise in the air to capture the moment.He won't have that anymore when the Warriors move across the bay to San Francisco to Chase Center next season.Everybody figures Curry will come up with a snazzy move to replace it."Shoot, I don't know, probably like a backflip or something like that," quipped Splash Brother Klay Thompson.A new signature shot? For sure.Curry vows to do something new and fun, but will just let it come to him when the time arrives. He's not pre-planning, and especially not now with the playoffs his top priority. The Warriors opened their first-round series with a 121-104 blowout of the Los Angeles Clippers."I've got to let it happen organically, just like this happened," Curry said. "I've got to let it happen organically. I don't really know. It'll come to me, though."Curry typically takes five tries total, fewer when he makes one, from just off the court by the end of the bench at the start of the tunnel before he sprints down the hallway back to the locker room. He takes a pass from security guard Curtis Jones and lets it fly for cheering fans who clamor in Oracle Arena's lower bowl, desperate for a glimpse of the two-time MVP getting ready for another game.Jones recalls a stretch when Curry made five straight tunnel shots, meaning he knocked it down on the first attempt in five consecutive home games — "which is almost unheard of," Jones said."The word I always use is priceless. It's been priceless," said Jones, 67, who has worked security at Warriors games for nearly 2 ½ decades.Before the final regular-season game at Oracle on April 7, Curry took his shots and then embraced Jones before sprinting back to the locker room.The shot will no longer work because of the configuration of the new arena. The tunnel at Oracle is on a line with the rim but will be at an angle behind the basket at Chase Center. Jones plans to work in the new venue and hopes to be part of Curry's to-be-determined signature move."Before the tunnel shot, people didn't come in near as fast," Jones recalled. "They come in early and have something to look forward to, so it made a big difference in the Oracle crowd. It made a major difference around here." Fans weren't the only ones watching what became the NBA's most must-see warmup."I love all his routines, pregame rituals. I know all of them. I watch all of them. We all watch them," Warriors teammate Quinn Cook said. "I know he'll come up with something to replace that — I mean, nothing will replace that. He has to have a new ending shot after his pregame shooting."Draymond Green knew a change was coming after recently taking a tour of Chase Center with Warriors COO Rick Welts."Rick Welts was telling me, 'We had one mistake in making this arena.' I'm like 'What was the mistake?' 'Well, with the way it's set up, Steph's tunnel shot, the angles, it won't work anymore,'" Green said. "It's like, 'Well, Steph better figure out another shot.' And he will. I'm not sure what it will be yet but he'll figure something out."Just don't count on the typically outspoken Green to help. "Nope. You can't give Steph ideas," Green said. "He'll just figure it out."But whatever it is, it will be hard to top the tradition at Oracle."He has a lot of them here," said his father, Dell Curry. "You've got to make new ones I guess. It's been fun."Curry has been known to mimic moves from a range of sports like curling, volleyball and soccer. Coach Steve Kerr will be eager to see what Curry pulls out of his hat."It's great for the fans. It's great for me to get a nice routine down," Curry said. "I didn't realize it would be such a big thing. But it is."___Advertisement

On the ensuing play, the Celtics' Al Horford passed to Jayson Tatum, who was fouled on a two-handed dunk. He completed the three-point play to make it 97-91 with 8.8 seconds left.The Pacers turned it over again and the Celtics were able to close out the game at the free throw line.Tatum scored 26 points, including his thunderous dunk down the stretch to help punctuate a 10-0 run by Boston over the final five minutes.Irving said being able to have this kind of performance at TD Garden after sitting out the playoffs last season wasn't lost on him."It's just been a long journey," Irving said. "From having those two knee surgeries and watching the team last year and finally getting chance to lace them up for the Boston Celtics in the NBA playoffs — it's nothing like it."After scoring only eight points in the third quarter of Game 1, the Pacers scored only 12 points in the fourth of Game 2."It's always been one quarter that kills us in the second half," Thaddeus Young said. "We're getting good looks and shots are not falling. ... We gotta put together a 48-minute game and we haven't been able to that."Bojan Bogdanovic led Indiana with 23 points. Young added 15 points.

Horford opened the final period scoring on a hook shot in the lane and Tyreke Evans responded with a 3-pointer on Indiana's first possession.But then Boston got hot, using a 16-0 run, including eight straight by Irving, to take an 86-82 lead with 5:04 to play. Indiana missed 10 straight shots during the run, finally breaking a nearly eight-minute scoring drought with a 3-pointer by Matthews in front of the Celtics' bench.Bogdanovic hit a 3-pointer from virtually the same spot as Matthews to put the Pacers back in front. Gordon Hayward responded with a jumper, before Bogdanovic hit another 3 over Horford that made it 91-89 Pacers with 2:16 remaining.Following an Indiana miss, Tatum connected on a 3-pointer from the corner. And after Horford blocked Bogdanovic at the rim, Tatum found a cutting Hayward for a layup and the Pacers were undone by their late turnovers."Missed a couple of good looks. Held them under a 100. The defense was still there. They made more timely baskets than we did," Matthews said.Horford was a game-time decision with an illness but was able to remain in the Celtics' starting lineup. He was noticeably a step slower at the outset and didn't' take his first shot until late in the second quarter. He didn't score his first points until the fourth, finishing with four points, 10 rebounds and four assists for the game."It wasn't just about putting points on the board, it was just about doing the little things," Irving said.

He has been for a very long time," defenseman P.K. Subban said of Rinne, who made his 86th consecutive playoff start for the Predators. "He's one of our most important players, if not the most important, and he showed that again tonight."After three consecutive one-goal games, Game 4 is Wednesday night in Dallas.Granlund's tiebreaker came only about 3½ minutes after the Stars got even at 2 on a goal from Tyler Seguin off a backhand pass from Stars captain Jamie Benn following some interesting puck play behind the net.Stars fans wanted a penalty when Subban was on the back and reaching over Alexander Radulov in a battle for the puck. But play continued and seconds later Benn delivered a spot-on pass from the side of the net to Seguin in front.Right after that, Benn had a point-blank shot that Rinne pushed aside with his skate to keep the game tied."He was terrific all night," Predators coach Peter Laviolette said. "At that point, you're under fire a little bit, they start to grab the energy in the building. ... That save was big."Granlund, acquired in a trade with Minnesota in late February, got the puck from Dante Fabbro after Kyle Turris won a faceoff against Benn.Rocco Grimaldi scored in his second game in a row for the Predators, and Filip Forsberg had a perfectly timed play for a goal.Mats Zuccarello also scored for the Stars, who played their first home playoff game in three years. American Airlines Center is less than 5 miles from the Cotton Bowl Stadium where they will play the Predators outside in the Winter Classic on New Year's Day next season."Never get too high, never get too low," Stars first-year coach Jim Montgomery said. "It's 2-1, I think we've been the better team two out of three games. Keep playing like that, usually hockey gods get back on your side."Nashville led 1-0 when Grimaldi took a shot from outside the right circle and got the puck past an unobstructed Ben Bishop, who finished with 25 saves.Grimaldi didn't have a goal in the last 13 regular-season games after scoring Feb. 19 at Dallas. The center was a scratch in the opener of this series scored a goal in Game 2 while filling in for Brian Boyle, who had an appendectomy after Game 1 and is considered week-to-week.The Predators led 2-0 when Nick Bonino flicked the puck high in the air — his pass went airborne from the circle left of Rinne along the boards and over both blue lines. Forsberg was at the blue line when the puck was over his head, and delayed enough to avoid going offside before gaining control and charging in for the goal.Montgomery said the Stars looked at replays when considering a challenge, but after seeing several angles "thought it was onside clearly."NOTES: Dallas was 0 for 4 on power plays and is 1 for 13 in the series.

After getting the call Friday, Walton changed plans to take some time off and flew to Sacramento the following day instead. He agreed to a deal that afternoon and was formally introduced as coach of the Kings on Monday."I knew these types of offers don't come available very often," Walton said. "I love coaching, so having that opportunity with this type of talented team and doing it alongside somebody the way I feel about Vlade made it too good to pass up on."Divac called Walton one of his basketball "soul mates," who embraces the same philosophies in style of play and building culture on a team. The relationship between the two goes back more than a decade to when they were teammates on the Lakers in 2004-05.Divac had wanted to interview Walton for the opening three years ago before hiring Dave Joerger but never got that chance as Walton took the job with the Lakers instead. He wasn't going to miss his chance again."When I believe in something, I just do it that way," Divac said. "No need to waste time. I knew exactly what I was looking for. When he was available, I just gave him a call."Walton takes over a Kings team that's in a much better position than it was three years ago thanks to progress made under Joerger and key acquisitions made by Divac. Joerger was fired Thursday following a 39-43 campaign that was the best record for the franchise in 13 years.Divac made that move because he felt Joerger wasn't the right coach to take the Kings to the next level and the postseason and hopes that Walton can do that.He inherits an up-and-coming team in Sacramento that features several talented young players acquired by Divac: guards De'Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield, forward Marvin Bagley III and center Willie Cauley-Stein. The Kings finished nine games out of a playoff spot after being tied for the Western Conference's eighth seed heading into the final game before the All-Star break."They play fast, they have 3-point shooting, they're young, they're versatile," Walton said. "That's how I want to play. That's how I think the game should be played. All that is right there with this group. There is still room and need for improvement like with almost every team in this league. What this team could be and what I think this team will be is very exciting from a coaching standpoint."Sacramento had its most wins since going 44-38 in 2005-06 during coach Rick Adelman's final season. That ended a run of eight straight playoff berths and Sacramento hasn't been back to the postseason since for the NBA's longest active drought.Joerger was the ninth coach since Adelman was fired in 2006 and none was able to post a winning record or earn a playoff berth. In fact, since moving to Sacramento before the 1985-86 season, the only winning seasons for the Kings came in Adelman's eight years at the helm, highlighted by a trip to the Western Conference final in 2002.Divac is now counting on Walton to be the one who can get the team back to the level it reached under Adelman, when the Kings were a contender for several years and played an entertaining brand of basketball."Maybe sometimes I'm greedy," Divac said. "We had a great season, don't get me wrong. It was a successful season for us but we can do better. I'm just trying to go to the next level."The 39-year-old Walton was 98-148 in three years with Los Angeles in his first full-time head coaching job. He was 37-45 this season and was unable to make the playoffs even once.Walton also has experience as an assistant for Golden State, helping the Warriors win the 2015 title and then leading the team to a 39-4 record, including 24 straight wins to open the 2015-16 season, as interim coach while Steve Kerr was sidelined following complications from a pair of back surgeries.That performance helped him get the job with the Lakers but he was unable to duplicate that success with a roster with far less talent during his first two years and then again this year, even with LeBron James on board."I learned a lot," Walton said. "The best way to learn in my mind is experience and I had a lot of experiences these last three years. I feel much more prepared and advanced as a coach right now that I did three years ago."___Advertisement

The American superstar wins his fifth Masters to claim his first major championship in 11 years.The triumph completed a remarkable comeback for Woods following years of surgeries and personal problems that convinced many that the American would never again win one of golf's four majors. The title, his 15th, moves him to within three of all-time leader Jack Nicklaus.-Tennis: 2017 Roger Federer. The Swiss, ranked 17th in the world, arrived at the Australian Open in January with minimal expectations after missing the last six months of the 2016 season with a knee injury. No one expected him to end his five-year barren run at the slams at Melbourne Park but incredibly, the then 35-year-old came from a break down in the fifth set to beat his great rival Rafael Nadal in the final. It handed Federer a record-extending 18th grand slam title. He has since won two more majors to take his haul to 20.-NFL: 2016 Peyton Manning. After neck surgery almost ended his National Football League career in 2011, Manning was back in the Super Bowl, leading the Denver Broncos to a 24-10 victory over the Carolina Panthers.-Tennis: 1999 Andre Agassi. The American was ranked 141st in the world at the end of 1997 but two years later he was world number one in year that included his victory in the 1999 French Open over Andrei Medvedev. TEAMSBaseball: 2004 Boston Red Sox. The Major League Baseball team erases an 86-year drought that was called the Curse of the Bambino when they won their first World Series title since 1918 after trading Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees. It came after Boston had rallied from a 0-3 deficit to defeat the Yankees to claim the best of seven American League championship.-Sailing: 2013 Oracle Team USA. The defending champions retain the America's Cup by winning seven consecutive races against New Zealand in San Francisco Bay after trailing eight races to one and facing elimination with one more loss. -Cricket: 2001 India. India were down and out as they were asked to follow on by Australian captain Steve Waugh in the second test in Kolkata in 2001. With the tourists holding a 274-run lead and a 1-0 advantage in the series, Waugh's decision appeared to be vindicated when India slumped to 3-115 in their second innings.However, a remarkable 281 by VVS Laxman and 180 by Rahul Dravid steered India to an exhilerating 171-run victory.India went on to triumph 2-1 in the series.-Soccer: 2012 Manchester City: Manchester City appeared to be suffering a dramatic collapse when they trailed Queens Park Rangers 2-1 on the final day of the season. But two stoppage-time goals just before the final whistle completed a 3–2 win over QPR and secured City the English top-flight title for the first time in 44 years. It was the first time the Premier League title was decided on goal difference. City's game-winning goal against QPR came 15 seconds after their cross-town rivals Manchester United had thought, albeit very briefly, that they had won the league title after defeating Sunderland 1–0.-Basketball: 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers end 52 years of Cleveland sports agony when they defeat the Golden State Warriors 93-89 in Game Seven of the NBA Finals.

With odds of 500-1 against England midway through their second innings at Headingley, Ian Botham struck 149 not out and Bob Willis took eight for 43 to pull off the unlikeliest of victories. England went on to win the series, dubbed Botham's Ashes, 3-1.-Soccer: 1968 Manchester United. A decade after Manchester United lost eight players in the 1958 Munich air disaster on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, they became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final.

AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — After a meandering search, St. John's finally settled on Mike Anderson as its new basketball coach.Anderson was hired Friday by the Red Storm after getting fired at Arkansas last month. He also had head coaching stints with Missouri and UAB before leading the Razorbacks to five postseason appearances and a 169-102 record in eight seasons.Once he was let go, it didn't take long for Anderson to land another job. Terms of the contract were not disclosed."I've been dreaming about this moment for the last nine days," St. John's athletic director Mike Cragg said during a news conference at Madison Square Garden. "And I found the right guy. We are going to win championships."The 59-year-old Anderson takes over for former St. John's star Chris Mullin, who resigned on April 9, citing a "recent personal loss." His older brother, Roddy, died last month at 58 after battling cancer for years.Anderson said he had not spoken to Mullin about the state of the program, but planned to reach out to him. Mullin guided the Red Storm to the NCAA Tournament this year for the only time in his four seasons at the helm. They were immediately eliminated by Arizona State in a First Four game, and the school doesn't have an NCAA Tournament victory since 2000.In the wake of Mullin's departure, St. John's drew criticism for being unable to lure initial coaching candidates during a protracted hiring process.Arizona State's Bobby Hurley and Loyola-Chicago's Porter Moser were targeted before deciding to stay at their schools. Iona coach Tim Cluess said in a statement Thursday he was contacted but was withdrawing his name from consideration. And according to reports, St. John's spoke to Yale coach James Jones and former Georgia Tech and George Mason coach Paul Hewitt about the job as well.In a radio interview Wednesday on WFAN, wealthy alum Mike Repole was critical of President Conrado "Bobby" Gempesaw, Vice President Joe Oliva, and the school's board of trustees.Ultimately, the Red Storm decided on Anderson, who is 369-200 in 17 seasons as a Division I head coach. He has never had a losing record.Neither Oliva nor Cragg would comment specifically on Repole's criticism, but both defended the process the school went through before picking Anderson."I would say nine days is a pretty thorough and efficient search," said Cragg, who came to St. John's from Duke last fall.Anderson, a native of Birmingham, Alabama, spent the first part of his career working for Nolan Richardson. Anderson played for Richardson at Tulsa before becoming an assistant under him with the Golden Hurricane.When Richardson left for Arkansas, Anderson joined him in Fayetteville. He was an assistant coach at Arkansas for 17 years, helping the Razorbacks win the 1995 national championship.Known for coaching up-tempo teams that press on defense, Anderson said his goal is to implement an exciting style of basketball that is "really entertaining." He said his teams would be "one of the top assist teams in the country.""They're going to be one of the top turnover teams in the country. One of the better scoring (and) field goal percentage teams," he added.Anderson said he envisions a team that's unpredictable."You don't know what we're going to do," he explained. "Our pressure may come from the half court. It may come full court. It may come from a zone. Now you've got to worry about what we're doing. I don't worry about what teams do. I worry more about what we're doing."Anderson spoke briefly with St. John's players Mustapha Heron and L.J. Figueroa, who attended the news conference.The new coach will have plenty of work to do in order to build a quality Big East roster for next season. Junior guards Shamorie Ponds and Justin Simon have declared for the NBA draft, while Figueroa and guard Bryan Trimble Jr. reportedly have placed their names in the transfer portal.Anderson, who doesn't have previous New York ties, said his plan is to recruit in the area."I had somebody ask me, 'Who's the guy who's going to recruit for you?' My staff's going to recruit. That's who's going to recruit. Have three guys that are going to be recruiting and you're going to see me out there as well," Anderson said."I think it comes down to building those relationships," he added. "I know that they're going to see me. They're going to get a chance to know me."Following the news conference, Anderson was scheduled to tour the school's on-campus facilities. He said the previous time he had been inside Carnesecca Arena was 2003 when he was the coach at UAB."I remember the last time I played (there), man, it was tight up in there," Anderson said. "I remember it being a really close environment and you put people on top of people, so I'm looking forward to getting over there and (seeing) what (has) been done since those days."___Advertisement
AdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — Joel Embiid scored and rebounded. He blocked shots and even threw the most important pass of the game.The only thing he didn't do is lose his cool after his hard foul triggered a scuffle.After having to sit out the last game, there was no way Embiid was going to risk an ejection and miss his chance to help the Philadelphia 76ers seize control of the series.Embiid had 31 points and 16 rebounds, and passed to Mike Scott for the go-ahead 3-pointer with 18 seconds left as the 76ers beat the Brooklyn Nets 112-108 on Saturday to take a 3-1 series lead.Embiid also had a flagrant foul that led to a scuffle and two ejections during an eventful return to the lineup after missing Game 3 with a sore left knee."I know these guys are going to go at me because they want me to retaliate, so I've got to be mature when I'm on the court and just stay cool and not react," Embiid said."Today I could have reacted but I felt like my team needed me more than they needed Jared Dudley, so I've just got to stay cool and mature and do my job."Tobias Harris had 24 points, eight rebounds and six assists for the 76ers. They can advance to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the second straight season with a victory at home Tuesday night.They got a big boost from the return of Embiid, who scored eight straight points in the fourth quarter after the Nets led by seven. He helped the 76ers overcome the loss of Jimmy Butler, who was ejected in the third quarter after Embiid's hard foul on Jarrett Allen.Even that ended up working out for the 76ers. Scott took what probably would have been Butler's position on the floor in the final seconds and turned Embiid's seventh assist into the go-ahead basket.Embiid also had six blocked shots."Just look at the magnitude of what the numbers say, the influence that the numbers say that he must have had on the game," Sixers coach Brett Brown said. "To have 31 points, 16 rebounds, seven assists, six blocked shots and you win, well it's hard to sort of say it any better than that. He was dominant."Caris LeVert scored 25 points after being inserted into the Nets' starting lineup. D'Angelo Russell and Allen each added 21.Dudley also was inserted into the starting lineup for the Nets and had been agitating the 76ers with his defense and his talking, but was gone midway through the third quarter as one of the central figures in the scuffle that spilled into the stands.Embiid swung his arm forcefully while fouling Allen, and Dudley quickly moved in and bumped Embiid. Butler then ran in and pushed Dudley to start the shoving. Dudley, Simmons and referee Ed Malloy all got knocked into the seats, and after a lengthy video review, Butler and Dudley were given technical fouls and ejected, and Embiid's foul was ruled a flagrant 1.Dudley said he was trying to send a message. The Nets have been upset over an elbow Embiid hit Allen with in Game 2 that they felt should have been an ejection, and were further angered after when Embiid laughed as he apologized in his press conference."When you have a guy giving flagrant fouls, I mean Joel Embiid is second in the league in flagrant fouls," Dudley said. "So for that elbow he had before just to have a flagrant 1, no fine, no nothing, laughing in the media, if you think that a team that I play on is going to have (to accept) that, that's another thing coming, especially on this young team."Embiid would later make the biggest mark with his offense. The 76ers were trying to get the ball to him trailing by one after Joe Harris' layup, but Embiid couldn't control the pass under the rim. But he regained the ball and found Scott in the corner for a 3 and a 110-108 lead.Allen then turned the ball over after three Sixers surrounded him and Harris closed out the scoring with two free throws. Nets coach Kenny Atkinson was angry afterward, feeling Allen was wrapped up by Harris as he tried to roll to the basket.Dudley and Simmons jawed at each other after Dudley gave him a long stare with his arms up after hitting a 3-pointer during a 9-0 run that gave Brooklyn a 63-53 lead shortly before halftime. The Nets led 63-57 at the break.TIP-INS76ers: The 76ers are 5-0 on the road against the Nets in the playoffs. ... Greg Monroe, who started Game 3 and had nine points and 13 rebounds in place of Embiid, played just one minute.Nets: Spencer Dinwiddie scored 18 points. ... Joe Harris went 0 for 6 from behind the arc and the NBA's leading 3-point shooter hasn't made one in the two games in Brooklyn. ... Backup F/C Ed Davis missed the game with a sprained right ankle.UP NEXTGame 5 is Tuesday night in Philadelphia.______Advertisement

CITY, Jan. 12, 2019 – The Oklahoma City Thunder announced today that the team will retire Nick Collison’s No. 4 on Wednesday, March 20 when the Thunder hosts the Toronto Raptors at Chesapeake Energy Arena.Collison announced his retirement this past May after spending all 15 years of his career with the Thunder franchise. His No. 4 will be the first number retired by the Thunder.“I am thrilled that Nick Collison will be the first Thunder player to have their number retired in Oklahoma City,” said Thunder Chairman Clayton I. Bennett. “He has cemented himself as part of the fabric of this community and our organization by setting an example of commitment, hard work and authenticity. Congratulations Nick.”Over the course of his career, Collison appeared in 910 regular season games (177 starts) and posted career averages of 5.9 points, 5.2 rebounds and 1.0 assist in 20.4 minutes per game. Additionally, Collison saw action in 91 postseason games where he averaged 4.3 points and 3.8 rebounds in 16.8 minutes.“Nick Collison's career in Oklahoma City was unique. Unique in that he helped create the internal standards for work ethic, selflessness, citizenship and ‎professionalism for an organization that was starting from scratch. Unique in that as a role player, he embedded himself as a legacy player for the Thunder because of his consistency both in times of success and adversity and respect for his teammates and the organization,” said Thunder Executive Vice President and General Manager Sam Presti. “It is fitting that Nick will continue his unique and singular relationship with the organization by being our first retired number.”Originally selected No. 12 overall in the 2003 NBA Draft, Collison is one of two players (Russell Westbrook) to spend the first 10 years of the Thunder era all with the team. He retired as one of Oklahoma City’s leaders in games played (second, 602), assists (fourth, 638), blocks (fourth, 258), rebounds (fifth, 2,561), steals (sixth, 296) and points (sixth, 2,846).  During his 10 seasons in Oklahoma City, Collison helped lead the Thunder to the second-best record in the NBA (.608; 489-315). The Iowa Falls native finished his career with 69 double-doubles and 184 games in which he scored in double figures.Additional Collison number retirement details will be released at a later date.NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

Armed with with their three best players, the Portland Trail Blazers easily dispatched the Minnesota Timberwolves, playing without Jimmy Butler (rest) Derrick Rose (left ankle) and Jeff Teague (knee), 111-81 in front of a sellout crowed of 19,522 Sunday night at the Moda Center. “It was a good bounce back game for us,” said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. “Obviously they’re a little undermanned, but I liked the way we played. I thought we had good rhythm offensively for most of the game, defensively as well. But like I said. without Butler and Moda Center and Teague, they’re a little undermanned.”Portland is now 7-3 overall and 4-2 at home this season. After a demoralizing home loss to the Lakers the night before and playing against a rested Timberwolves team, Sunday night’s game had all the trappings of a difficult night for the home team. But with Jusuf Nurkić playing determined basketball on both ends from the opening tip and both CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard making up for poor shooting performances the night before, the Trail Blazers had more than enough firepower to overcome a shorthanded Timbewolves team. At least after the first quarter. The Timberwolves were able to keep the game close in the first 12 minutes behind 8 points apiece from Andrew Wiggins and Karl-Anthony Towns, though that wouldn’t be nearly enough to stave off the impending route. By time the second quarter came around, both the Trail Blazers’ starting and bench units were able to take advantage of a thin Timberwolves rotation. Portland held the Timberwolves to 21 percent shooting in the second while making half of their own shots to outscore Minnesota 31-18 in the quarter and take a 61-45 lead into the halftime intermission. The score would never get closer than that. While the Timberwolves technically returned to the court after the intermission, their interest in putting up a fight, let alone winning, seemed casual at best. Portland played their regular rotation in the third quarter, putting up 31 points on 52 percent shooting, while holding the Timberwolves to 19 points to put the game away before the fourth quarter. "I think it speaks to our maturity," said Damian Lillard. "In the past, we might have let that one slip last night and then come back and been, I guess, too emotional about it, like a younger team would be, kind of holding on to it. It would carry over to tonight, a team without Jimmy Butler and then we would take this one for granted and not have the same energy as last night and end up in a dog fight. Maybe we win it or lose it, but tonight, we came out sharp. Once we got them down, we held them down and pulled away."From there, all that was left was for both teams to play out the string in the fourth, not that the final 12 minutes were uneventful. Rookie Gary Trent Jr. scored his first points of his NBA career, Caleb Swanigan grabbed five rebounds in 10 minutes and the arena busted into a “MEYERS LEONARD” chant to cap off the best game of the season for the oft maligned center in his sixth season out of Illinois. “The truth is I was just out there having fun, playing hard," said Leonard, who finished with 15 points, 12 rebounds, two assists and a steal in 21 minutes. "I looked at my shot – I actually didn’t shoot the ball as well as I normally do but my teammates were looking for me, a couple offensive rebounds, making my free throws, so it was fun to be out there. Big win for us, especially after last night. Just happy to continue to do what we do, but I just had fun out there, that’s all there is to it."Five Trail Blazers scored in double figures led by Jusuf Nurkic, who went 8-of-11 from the field for 19 points to go with 12 rebounds, two assists and a block in 23 minutes. It was his second straight double-double and his fifth of the season.Damian Lillard finished with 18 points (6-16 FG, 1-4 3-PT, 5-6 FT), five rebounds, five assists and one steal in 28 minutes.CJ McCollum had 16 points (7-14 FG, 1-4 3-PT, 1-1 FT), three rebounds, one assist and two steals in 28 minutes.Meyers Leonard led Portland’s reserves with 15 points (3-7 FG, 1-4 3-PT, 8-8 FT) and 12 rebounds to go with two assists and one steal. It was his first double-double of the season. His scoring and rebounding totals were both season highs.Zach Collins scored 11 points off the bench (2-5 FG, 1-2 3-PT, 6-6 FT) to go with two rebounds. It was the sixth game this season that Collins scored in double figures.• Portland’s 111-81 victory marked its largest margin of victory this season (19, Oct. 30vat Houston) and tied the biggest win over the Timberwolves in franchise history (121-91, 3/30/91). • The Trail Blazers held Minnesota to 81 points, which is the fewest points scored in an NBA game this season. • The Timberwolves shot 31.2% from the field, which is lowest field goal percentage for a Trail Blazers opponent this season. • The Trail Blazers bench outscored Minnesota’s reserves, 44-23. • The Trail Blazers made a season-high 28 free throws (of 32, 87.5%). • Portland outrebounded the Timberwolves, 66-38, and outscored them in the paint, 52-40. • Portland’s 28 rebound advantage on the glass was the second-biggest rebound differential in the league this season (29, Ind. vs. Mem. 10/17/18). • The Trail Blazers outscored Minnesota in second chance points, 22-13. The Timberwolves bested Portland on the fast break, 14-13.• With 111 points Sunday night, the Trail Blazers have now scored at least 100 points in their first 10 games this season for the first time since 1981."We had a good flow offensively. Obviously the second unit has established themselves as an integral part of the team. We’re scoring a lot of points. Defensively, it’s been a little sporadic, but I think what I like best is being 7 and 3.” -- Terry Stotts what he's liked in the first 10 gamesThe Trail Blazers continue a six-game homestand Tuesday night by hosting the Milwaukee Bucks in their first and only visit to the Moda Center this season. “In this league, every night is going to be different," said Jusuf Nurkić. "There is big games coming up and then a long trip coming up, so we’re going to have a nice game and we need to be ready, so we’re going to work out and prepare what we can to do best preparation for ourselves and come to play.”




That would not be the case in their third straight game against similar competition. Behind stellar, stat-stuffing performances from CJ McCollum, Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkić and a dominant performance from the bench unit, the Trail Blazers built a 22-point first-half lead before going on to defeat the Charlotte Hornets 127-96 in front of a sellout crowd of 19,393 Friday night at the Moda Center."I thought we played a really good basketball game," said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. "The first half at both ends -- we were moving the ball, making plays for each other offensively, defensively we had 19 either deflections or blocks in the first half. I was proud of the way we played in the third quarter to not give in to complacency. So it was really a good game. CJ was really in a groove obviously in the first quarter. I liked the demeanor of our team the entire game. At both ends of the floor, I thought we were really locked in and played the right way."The Trail Blazers are now 26-17 overall and 17-7 at home this season. They have matched their longest winning streak of the season at four games, have won six of their last seven and finish a five-game homestand with a 4-1 record. Portland has now won four-in-a-row versus the Hornets and their last 11 versus the Eastern-Conference club at the Moda Center. Portland wasted no time showing their quality against a Hornets team playing the fourth of a six-game Western Conference road trip. The Blazers used a 9-0 run before four minutes had elapsed to take a 13-3 lead in the first quarter. CJ McCollum picked up right where he left off after braking out of a slump with 24 points in Wednesday’s victory versus the Bulls, scoring 12 consecutive points for the Trail Blazers to lead the home team to a 37-27 lead going into the second quarter. With a comfortable lead, Terry Stotts turned the game over to the five-man bench unit to start the second quarter. And after a bit of a slow start, resulting in Charlotte getting to within four points early in the quarter, Portland went on a 14-0 run and outscored their counterparts 22-4 before being subbed out at the 4:45 mark. Between McCollum’s scoring in the first quarter, the bench’s scoring and defense in the second and Nurkić protecting the rim with five blocks, Portland outscored Charlotte by 11 in the quarter to take a 70-49 lead into the intermission."I thought we did a great job of echoing the call," said Lillard. "When they were calling their plays out, a lot of times we echo it back to the bench so they can tell us look for this or look for that, but we was pretty sharp this morning in shoot around, and we pretty much said it to each other for the first part of this game. Where we hear something, we was communicating what was coming to each other so I think we were just in a much better position to make those plays."Even though they came with a much more dominant performance in the first half of Friday’s game than they did in their last two games, their second-half effort was just as good, if not better, than in wins versus the Knicks and Bulls. Portland dictated the pace on both ends of the floor to nearly double Charlotte’s point total in the third to take a 101-68 advantage into the fourth and final quarter. All that was left to be decided was whether Nurkic would get the two assists he needed to log a triple-double. Stotts allowed “the Bosnian Beast” to play the first two minutes of the fourth, but Portland went scoreless in that stretch before conceding that it simply wasn’t meant to be."I told him I would give him two minutes," said Stotts. "Honestly, it’s something you have to do but I didn’t necessarily like doing it because I thought it took away from the rhythm of the game and kind of made it tough for the four new guys coming into the game. We gave it a shot though."CJ McCollum scored a game-high 30 points (12-20 FG, 5-11 3-PT, 1-1 FT) to go with six rebounds, two assists and one steal. It was his seventh game this season with 30-plus points.Jusuf Nurkic recorded 11 points (5-6 FG, 1-1 FT), 11 rebounds, eight assists, one steal and six blocks in 30 minutes. His eight assists and six blocks matched his career highs. Nurkic is the fourth player in NBA history to record at least 11 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and six blocks in 30 minutes or fewer."His presence in the paint defensively was really impressive," said Stotts. "He ended up with six blocks. His defense was good. Nothing was forced on the offense. I thought the impact he made defensively was the biggest thing."Damian Lillard finished with 20 points (8-16 FG, 2-7 3-PT, 2-2 FT), four rebounds, five assists, three steals and a career high four blocks. Evan Turner logged 15 points (6-9 FG, 1-2 3-PT, 2-2 FT), five rebounds, three assists and one steal in 21 minutes off the bench. It was the third time he has scored in double figures in the last four games. • The Trail Blazers won their fourth straight game, matching the team’s longest winning streak of the season (four, Nov. 4 - Nov. 11).• The Trail Blazers had a season-high 31 assists on a season-high 52 field goals. It was the team’s fifth straight game with at least 25 assists.• Portland shot 55.9% from the field (52-of-93), which is their third-highest field goal percentage of the season. Charlotte shot 40.0% from the field (36-of-40).• The Trail Blazers scored a season-high 26 fast break points while the Hornets finished with 10 fast break points.• Portland matched its season high for blocks in a game (10) in the first half. The Trail Blazers finished with 16 blocks and 10 steals. Their 16 blocks were one shy of the franchise record (17, 1/19/79 at New Orleans).  The Hornets had two blocks and three steals.• Portland outrebounded the Hornets, 47-43, and outscored them in the paint, 48-36.• Portland scored 70 points in the first half, matching their highest-scoring first half of the sea-son (third time). The Trail Blazers also matched their highest-scoring first quarter of the season with 37 points (third time).• The Portland reserves outscored the Charlotte bench, 48-43.With the homestand now complete, the Trail Blazers hit the road for a back-to-back series starting Sunday versus the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets."(Denver) came here and they got one," said Lillard. "We had a shot at the end of the game to beat them and we didn’t feel like we played that well, so we’ve just got to take this brand of basketball that we’ve been playing the last few games and take it to their court and go get us another win."Tipoff is scheduled for 5 p.m.




The two-seed Portland Trail Blazers put a cap on their perfect 2018 Las Vegas Summer League by defeating the one-seed Los Angeles Lakers 91-73 in the Tournament Championship Tuesday night at Thomas & Mack Center on the campus of UNLV.“We have a lot of first-rounders, a lot of guys with experience,” said Trail Blazers point guard Wade Baldwin IV. “Coming in the goal was to win a championship and we went undefeated and we did that as a team.”With the win, the Trail Blazers finish their run in Las Vegas with a 7-0 record. Tuesday night’s game was a rematch of the 2017 Las Vegas Summer League Tournament Finals, which the Lakers won handily, and the Trail Blazers wasted no time exacting their revenge by jumping out to an early double-digit lead.After struggling on the offensive end for most of the night in their semifinal victory versus the Grizzlies Monday night, Portland made nine of their first 10 shots and their first three three-pointers and never looked back. A 10-0 run late in the first quarter gave the Trail Blazers a 27-10 lead, an advantage that the Lakers would get down to 31-19 before the start of the second quarter. The Trail Blazers extended their lead in the second quarter, taking a 50-33 lead into the intermission thank to balanced scoring from KJ McDaniels (nine points), Jake Layman (eight points) and John Jenkins (eight points).The Lakers managed to cut Portland’s lead to 12 on multiple occasions in the third quarter, but Portland finished the quarter on a 10-2 run to take a 71-51 lead into the fourth. The Lakers were never able to sustain a run to overcome the 20-point deficit, allowing the Trail Blazers to coast to yet another double-digit victory, their sixth, in summer league play. “Last year it was Portland and the Lakers, Lakers got the job done last year,” said Baldwin IV, who was name Second Team All-Summer League prior to Tuesday’s game. “It’s redemption for this team. We played together this entire tournament and we put it all together in this game and came out with a win.”Six Trail Blazers finished the game in double figures led by McDaniels, who took the Tournament Championship MVP with a 17-point, seven-rebound performance. Baldwin IV had a bounce-back game Tuesday night after turning in his worst effort Monday night versus the Grizzlies, finishing with 14 points, six assists and four rebounds in 20 minutes. Rookie Gary Trent Jr. finished his first foray into professional basketball by going 6-of-15 from the field for 12 points to go with two rebounds, two assists and two steals in 23 minutes. Anfernee Simons, who sat out Monday’s game with a hip contusion, returned to the lineup for the final and finished with seven points, three rebounds and two steals. Layman added 10 points and three rebounds in 22 minutes, Jenkins capped off a strong summer league with 11 points and three rebounds and Archie Goodwin, the leading scorer in summer league history, finished with 10 points, seven rebounds, two assists and two steals.

"It was a grind-it-out kind of game," said Lillard. "I thought our team did a good job at just being present for the entire game. Our bench once again came through, gave us another spark down the stretch. The end of the third, beginning of the fourth, they had a really good stretch, opened up the game a little bit and left it there for us to come close it out. So another team effort.”The Trail Blazers are now 9-3 overall and 6-2 at home this season. Portland has now won three-straight for the second time this season and improve to 4-1 on their current homestand. Though they would go build double-digit leads at various points throughout the game, including early in the fourth quarter, the Trail Blazers simply weren't able to shake a Clippers team that seemed to answer every run. Portland goes up by nine at the end of the first quarter, L.A. cuts it to three by midway through the second quarter. Al-Farouq hits a three-pointer to put the Trail Blazers up 78-68 with just over five minute to play in the third, the Clippers finish the quarter by outscoring the Blazers 13-6 to cut the lead to three going into the fourth."We weren’t getting the cushion that we’d like to have," said Trail Blazers head coach Terru Stotts. "We’d get up and then kind of lose it, get up and lose it. But I liked the way we were able to finish. They put a small shooting lineup out there that was challenging. But we made good plays at the end. It wasn’t, even though we led most of the game, it didn’t feel like we were ever in control of the game."They came close to pulling away in the fourth quarter after Jusuf Nurkić made two free throws to give Portland their largest lead of the night at 97-85 with just over seven mintues to play in regulation, with the bench once again doing a lot of the heavy lifting."(The bench) had a good rhythm and they were able to expand the lead," said Stotts. "I think when the starters came back with seven-something to go, they were able to give us that cushion, that’s important. They’ve done that many times this year where not only do they maintain the lead, sometimes they extend it."Damian Lillard led all scorers with 25 points, despite not shooting a free throw, on 11-of-25 shooting from the field and 3-of-7 shooting from three. The 6-3 guard out of Weber State also added four assists, four rebounds and a steal in 35 minutes.CJ McCollum followed up a 40-point performance Tuesday night versus the Bucks with 23 points on 8-of-20 shooting, seven rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes.Jusuf Nurkić finished a rebound short of a double-double with 16 points and nine rebounds while also blocking three shots before fouling out in 23 minutes.Al-Farouq Aminu added 11 points and eight rebounds and Zach Collins also came a rebound away from a double-double with 10 points and nine rebounds in 26 minutes off the bench.Both Danilo Gallinari and Lou Williams put up 20 points for the Clippers.• The Trail Blazers had 37 points in the first quarter, marking their highest-scoring first period of the season.• Portland outrebounded the Clippers, 53-41, including a 14-7 advantage on the offensive glass.• The Trail Blazers had 20 second chance points to the Clippers 10 second chance points.• The Trail Blazers held the Clippers to 3-of-13 shooting (23.1%) from the three-point line in the second half.

Given Portland’s performance in the third quarter, one imagines the coaching staff drove home that point during the halftime intermission. After a nip-and-tuck first half that saw seven ties and four lead changes, the Trail Blazers scored the first nine points of the second half and built an 18-point lead in the third quarter before riding out the fourth quarter for a 111-101 victory in front of a crowd of 19,026 Monday at the Moda Center. “Good win. I liked the way we came out both halves, the first half and second half got off to good starts," said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. "Obviously, I think New York plays hard and did some good things to keep themselves in the game, but overall, it was just a solid win."With the win, the Trail Blazers extend their winning streak versus the Knicks to five games and have won the season series for the second straight year. The Trail Blazers are now 24-17 overall, their best record at the midway point of the season since 2014-15, 16-7 at home and have won four of their last five games."You think you should probably go in and win every game, but with that being said, I think we had the toughest schedule in the league for the first 41 games and to come out 24-17, we’re in a good place," said Stotts. "But it’s a long season and there’s not much you can do – you can’t look back on it. It’s a long season and every game is going to be competitive.”For a brief moment at the start of Monday’s game, it looked as though the Trail Blazers might bring the kind of effort that would allow them to all but put the game away in the first half. The Knicks had to call a timeout after Jusuf Nurkić scored the first six points of the game, failed to score for the first three minutes and didn’t net their first field goal until the 7:45 mark of the first quarter. But after jumping out to a fast start, the Trail Blazers were quickly lulled into a false sense of security, resulting in poor defense, a few head-scratching turnovers and unnecessary fouls, which proved to be the most detrimental of their mistakes born of lackadaisical play. "I though the first couple minutes we did good then I don't know what happened," said Nurkić. "Their record not necessarily show how they play. You never know who they're going to play or how they're going to play. We just need to take the game serious for us."It would continue on that way for the entirety of the first half, with the Knicks at one point leading by as many as six points before the Trail Blazers closed the second quarter on a 7-1 run to take a 54-53 lead into the intermission. With the first half behind them, the Trail Blazers came out of the break like a team that knew one quarter of quality play would be enough to get a win. After Portland's initial salvo gave the home team their first double digit lead at 65-55 with 7:18 to play in the quarter, an 11-1 run capped by three Damian Lillard free throws gave the Trail Blazers their largest advantage of the night at 86-68 with a minute to play in the third. The Knicks would get the lead down to single digits just once thereafter, and that came with just 1:21 to play in regulation. All that was left was Jusuf Nurkić making a free throw with just over a minute to play to secure the last points of the game and a 10-point victory for Portland. "We talked about some of the things that we were doing in the first half that we needed to do better," said Lillard. "We came out and fixed it. I thought there was a few loose balls, a few hustle plays that they showed at halftime that they got to, they was just outworking us and we were kind of playing their record instead of the team that they are even though they gave us a tough game in New York. Like I said, we fixed it and we had a much better second half and got another win.”Jusuf Nurkic led the Trail Blazers with 20 points (7-9 FG, 6-9 FT) to go with eight rebounds and one block. Nurkic has scored at least 20 points in four straight games and six of the last seven. He scored seven of his points in the fourth quarter.Damian Lillard recorded 17 points (5-14 FG, 2-6 3-PT, 5-5 FT), four rebounds, nine assists and one steal. CJ McCollum had 17 points on 7-of-17 shooting (2-7 3-PT, 1-1 FT) to go with three re- bounds, two assists, one steal and one block.Jake Layman recorded the first double-double of his career, finishing with 10 points (3-5 FG, 1-2 3-PT, 3-4 FT), 10 rebounds and four assists. His 10 rebounds and four assists were career highs. Evan Turner notched 10 points (3-4 FG, 1-1 3-PT, 3-5 FT), five rebounds and three assists in 22 minutes off the bench.Al-Farouq Aminu had eight points, nine rebounds, two assists and two steals. Seth Curry scored 13 points on 5-of-9 shooting (3-6 3-PT) to go with one rebound, one steal and one block.Enes Kanter led the Knicks with 18 points (8-12 FG, 2-5 FT) and 14 rebounds off the bench. Noah Vonleh had a double-double of 16 points (5-12 FG, 3-5 3-PT, 3-4 FT) and 14 rebounds to go with two assists.• Portland improved its record to 24-17 through 41 games. It is the team’s best record at the midpoint of the regular season since the 2014-15 season (30-11).• The Trail Blazers swept the season series against the Knicks for the second straight season.• The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Knicks, 51-48. It was the fourth time in the last five games that Portland had at least 50 rebounds.• Portland had 20 second chance points on 12 offensive rebounds. New York scored 12 second chance points off of 14 offensive boards.• Both teams had 49 bench points and 46 points in the point. All five of Portland’s reserves who played scored at least seven points.• Portland recorded six blocks and seven steals while the Knicks had two blocks and nine steals.• The Trail Blazers dished out 25 assists on 40 made field goals while the Knicks had 18 assists on 36 field goals."I like the fact that we’ve had a little bit of ups and downs already. We’ve experienced some adversity early in the season and we got through it. We got to the midway point feeling good about ourselves.”  -- Damian LillardThe Trail Blazers continue a five-game homestand and a three-game run of games versus teams from the Eastern Conference with a tilt versus the Chicago Bulls. Tipoff is scheduled for Wednesday at 7 p.m.




After losing back-to-back games on the road, the Trail Blazers (15-13) return home to host the Toronto Raptors (23-7), owners of the best record in the NBA. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. • Friday’s game marks the first of two meetings between the Trail Blazers and the Raptors during the 2018-19 season. Toronto swept the season series in 2017-18, 2-0. The Raptors have won the last six games between the Trail Blazers and the Raptors.• In two games against the Raptors last season, Damian Lillard averaged 34.0 points (56.1% FG, 40.0% 3-PT, 88.9% FT), 2.5 rebounds, 6.0 assists and 1.00 steal. Lillard has averaged 26.8 points per game against Toronto for his career, which is his second-highest scoring average against any team.• CJ McCollum averaged 18.5 points (43.8% FG, 36.4% 3-PT, 71.4% FT), 2.5 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.00 block in two games against Toronto last season. McCollum has made at least three three-pointers in four of his last six games against the Raptors.• In two games against Portland during the 2017-18 season, Kyle Lowry averaged 17.0 points (40.7% FG, 41.7% 3-PT, 87.5% FT), 7.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists. Lowry has scored 20-plus points in five of his last eight games against the Trail Blazers.• Kawhi Leonard has averaged 26.8 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.50 blocks and 1.25 steals in his last four games against Portland.The Trail Blazers have no injuries to report for Friday night's game.Jonas Valanciunas (left thumb) and Norman Powell (left shoulder) are out and Kawhi Leonard (right hip) is questionable for Friday's game.

On the same court less than 24 hours later, they made up for it against another of the West’s hottest teams. The Trail Blazers finished the first half on a 13-0 run and were able to hold that lead for the rest of the game on the way to defeating the Houston Rockets 110-101 in front of a sellout crowd of 19,577 Saturday night at the Moda Center. "It was a good bounce-back win after last night's game," said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. "It was a really good win against a really good team."Portland is now 23-17 overall and 15-7 at home this season. With the win, the Trail Blazers have secured the season series 2-1, their first season series advantage versus Houston since the 2014-15 season. The loss breaks an six-game winning streak for Houston, though they’ve won 12 of their last 14. Despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Trail Blazers matched the Rockets’ energy early. Portland center Jusuf Nurkić, who has played the best basketball of his career over the past two weeks, was especially effective in the early going, scoring Portland’s first six points."I thought Nurk got us off to a great start," said Stotts. "We were able to take advantage of him inside with their switching."But for as good as Nurkić was, Rockets guard Austin Rivers was even better, going 4-of-4 from three for 12 points in the first five minutes. Rivers would go on to score 14 points on perfect 5-of-5 shooting from the field in the first quarter, but with Nurkić, Damian Lillard and CJ McCollum all scoring six points and Zach Collins pitching in five, the Blazers and Rockets went into the second quarter tied 30-30. Portland went scoreless for nearly three minutes early in the second quarter, which allowed Houston to go on a 10-2 run did give the road team a 40-36 lead with just over six minutes to play in the half.But the Trail Blazers would answer forcefully, going on a 20-3 run in the final 4:26 of the first half to take a 59-46 lead into the intermission. After holding James Harden to nine points in the first half, the MVP guard put up 20 points in the third quarter to cut the lead to nine points going into the fourth quarter. But the Trail Blazers have yet to lose when going into the fourth quarter with a lead, and that streak would continue Saturday night. The Rockets got within five points after a reverse dunk by Gerald Green with 9:08 to play in regulation, but the Trail Blazers answered with five straight points to put the lead to 93-83 with 6:43 to play. Behind the play of Nurkić, McCollum and Evan Turner, whose defense on Harden was crucial in keeping the 2018 MVP from scoring 40 points for the first time in his last six games, the Trail Blazers were able to get enough stops to come away with the nine-point victory. "Just had to be aggressive and try to limit what he likes to do," said Turner. "He's an amazing offensive player, he's been on a hell of a run and obviously he's the head of the snake. So I was trying to pick him up, wear him down, tire him out and not try and get any cheap fouls. Just contest his shot, make sure I don't foul when I contest and that's pretty much it."Jusuf Nurkic finished with team highs of 25 points (11-18 FG, 3-6 FT) and 15 rebounds to go with three assists. It was the fifth time in the last six games that Nurkic scored 20-plus points and it was his 20th double-double of the season.CJ McCollum scored 24 points (9-21 FG, 3-8 3-PT, 3-4 FT) to go with four rebounds and four assists. It was his 19th game of 20-plus points this season. Damian Lillard recorded 17 points (5-15 FG, 2-5 3-PT, 5-6 FT), five rebounds, a season-high 12 assists and two steals for his fourth double-double of the season.In his second start of the season, Evan Turner recorded 14 points (6-11 FG, 2-2 FT), three rebounds, four assists, one steal and one block. It was the 14th time this season he has scored in double figures. Al-Farouq Aminu registered seven points (3-6 FG, 1-2 3-PT), eight rebounds, two assists and one steal. Jake Layman scored nine points on 3-of-7 shooting (1-4 3-PT, 2-2 FT) to go with two rebounds in 21 minutes off the bench.James Harden scored a game-high 38 points on 13-of-35 shooting (5-17 3-PT, 7-7 FT) to go with five rebounds, seven assists, one steal and one block. Clint Capela finished with 13 points (5-8 FG, 3-4 FT) and a game-high 21 rebounds.• With the victory, Portland claimed the season series over the Rockets, 2-1. It is the first time the Trail Blazers have won the season series over the Rockets since 2014-15.• The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Rockets, 47-40, and outscored them in the paint, 54-44.• Portland had 27 assists on 43 field goals while the Rockets recorded 13 assists on 39 field goals.• The Trail Blazers committed a season-low 11 personal fouls. The Rockets committed 22 personal fouls. Portland attempted 20 free throws while Houston had 12 free throw attempts.• Portland had 17 offensive rebounds leading to 21 second chance points while the Rockets scored seven second chance points off of 10 offensive boards.• The Trail Blazers turned the ball over just nine times and forced Houston into 12 turnovers.• Portland’s reserves outscored the Houston bench, 23-22. "Well, we held (Harden) to under 40, so I guess that's a win." -- Terry StottsAfter splitting an all-home back-to-back, the Trail Blazers continue a five-game homestand by hosting the New York Knicks Monday night in their only visit to the Moda Center this season. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. 









After defeating the Lakers 16 straight times, a streak covering a span of 1,706 days, the Trail Blazers dropped their first game to Los Angeles in nearly five years with a 114-110 loss in front of a sellout crowd of 19,848 Saturday night at the Moda Center."It was a good comeback, came up a little short obviously," said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. "It was one of those night shooting the three, I thought we had a lot of good looks that didn’t drop. It’s one of those games. But I was pleased with how we came back and got within striking distance. We had our chances at the end."Portland is now 6-3 overall and 3-2 at home this season. The Trail Blazers looked as if they had a great chance of extending their streak versus the Lakers to 17 games after going on a 20-5 run in the first quarter to take a 22-12 lead with 4:15 to play in the first quarter. But the Lakers bench would get the visitors back in the game, going 16-7 to end the quarter to cut the Trail Blazers’ lead to 29-28 going into the second quarter. But after playing to a duel in the second quarter, the Lakers absolutely demolished the Trail Blazers in the 12 minutes immediately following the halftime intermission. By time the third quarter was over, the Lakers had outscored the Trail Blazers 32-16 on nearly 60 percent shooting in the quarter to take an 88-73 lead into the fourth.“I thought we had some look inside that we didn’t finish," said Stotts of the third quarter. "We had a couple turnovers during that stretch that they converted quickly in transition. I’d have to go back and look at it, but usually it’s two or three things. I know the turnovers between one timeout and the next timeout, we had two or three turnovers that they converted right away, and that’s when the lead kind of ballooned from 8 to 15.”After Los Angeles extended their lead to 20 early in the fourth, Portland went on a late-game run thanks to seven Lakers turnovers and some timely shotmaking from CJ McCollum and Damian Lillard. The Trail Blazers would ultimately cut the Lakers lead to 109-104 with just over a minute to play in regulation.But between trading baskets and coming up on the wrong side of a few close calls from the officials, they were unable to make up enough ground to force overtime -- due in large part to shooting just 6-of-35 from three -- let alone secure the win."I think the entire game we didn’t shoot the ball really well from three," said Damian Lillard. "When you’re not shooting the ball, you can’t let that impact what you do on the defensive end. They had a run. When you’re not making shots that means you’ve got to go to the other end and you’ve got to be really sharp. We just weren’t sharp enough. They got out in transition, hit a few threes, got to the rim, got to the line. We kind of just let them have their way and that was the obvious time to tighten up – when we wasn’t making shots.”Damian Lillard finished with 30 points on 10-of-23 shooting from the field and 2-of-9 shooting from three, four rebounds, four assists and three steals in 36 minutes. It was Lillard third game with at least 30 points this season.CJ McCollum also finished with 30 points, though he also had a difficult time hitting from outside, going 2-of-8 from three. McCollum also added five rebounds and four assists in 36 minutes.Jusuf Nurkic got his fourth double-double of the season with 14 points and 13 rebounds to go with two blocks and two assists in 30 minutes. Al-Farouq Aminu also grabbed 13 rebounds while also logging four points, two assists and two blocks in 32 minutes.Evan Turner and Zach Collins combined to score 21 points of the bench.The Lakers were led by LeBron James, who went 9-of-20 from the field for 28 points to go with seven assists and five rebounds in 31 minutes. Rajon Rondo added 17 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in just under 26 minutes. Kyle Kuzma and JaVale McGee each added 12 points.• Portland outscored the Lakers 37-26 in the fourth quarter, but came up short as the Lakers defeated the Trail Blazers for the first time since March 3, 2014.• The Trail Blazers scored a season-high 19 fast break points while the Lakers scored 17 fast break points.• The Trail Blazers recorded 10 steals while the Lakers had nine. Los Angeles had 11 blocks to Portland’s five.• Both teams had 50 rebounds. The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Lakers on the offensive glass, 16-9, resulting in a 17-14 advantage for Portland in second chance points.• Portland and Los Angeles both recorded 20 assists.The Trail Blazers won't have long thing about Saturday night's loss, as they host the Minnesota Timberwolves Sunday night in a rare all home back-to-back series. Tipoff is scheduled for 6 p.m.









But the Trail Blazers ultimately decided to pick up Layman’s third-year option, ensuring his contract for next season would be guaranteed. “I was out in Portland working out, my mindset was I’m going to workout with the team, work my butt off and show them that if they pick (the option) up, I’m ready to play,” said Layman. “But if not, I’ll be ready to go somewhere else and do the same thing. I was so happy when they picked it up, definitely nervous during that time period.”And if Layman is able to knock down shots and attack the rim as well as he did Sunday afternoon versus the Hawks at the Las Vegas Summer League, he might have an opportunity to earn more playing time now that he knows he’ll be back next season. After a rough shooting performance in Portland’s first game, Layman went 9-of-14 from the field and 4-of-5 from three to finish with 23 points to lead the Trail Blazers to an 85-68 victory versus Atlanta at Thomas & Mack Center on the campus of UNLV. “I think the first game, everybody was really excited to get out there. I wouldn’t say nerves, just a lot of juice in that first game,” said Layman. “Didn’t shoot it as well as I wanted to, but I was still being aggressive, being confident out there and I think today it definitely showed a little more. The Trail Blazers are now 2-0 in Las Vegas with one game to play before the start of the second annual Summer League Tournament. One would hope Layman would look comfortable playing in his third summer league, which features all 30 NBA teams for the first time in the exhibition’s history, and that has mostly been the case through two games in Las Vegas. While he only managed to make five of his 12 attempts in Portland’s summer league opener against the Jazz, he made his presence felt on the glass by grabbing four offensive rebounds, one of which he converted into a highlight dunk in the fourth quarter.And on Sunday, found his rhythm from outside, hitting four three-pointers while also finishing an alley-oop, blocking two shots and grabbing two steals in 20 minutes.“I feel like last year, his narrative was he missed open shots and that was that,” said assistant coach Jim Moran, who is handling heading coaching duties in Las Vegas. “Now when I’m watching him he’s just shooting with confidence, he’s letting everything come to him, he’s not forcing it. He’s had two really good games, he’s got a good rhythm, he had a great offensive rebound dunk yesterday, he had a nice transition and-one. It’s just nice to see him under control, playing with poise, but more importantly, playing with confidence.”Layman isn’t the only player on Portland’s summer league roster who is experiencing the positive effects associated with a boost of confidence. Rookie Anfernee Simons, who Portland selected with the 24th overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft out of IMG Academy, has shown through two games that he’s up to the task of playing against NBA caliber players despite being 19 and not playing collegiate basketball last season. “I catch on to things pretty quick, so after those two days of practice back in Portland, I felt like I was ready,” said Simons. “When I came out here, I felt like I was good.”Which he was Sunday versus the Hawks, finishing with 12 points on 4-of-9 shooting from the field and 2-of-3 shooting from three, four rebounds and three steals in just under 20 minutes. What’s more, Simons help hold rookie Trae Young, the fifth overall pick of the 2018 Draft, scoreless in the first half. “I think I played pretty well against (Young),” said Simons. “Played good defense, got into him a little bit and cause a little disruption.”John Jenkins, who is the only starter who isn’t under contract with the Trail Blazers for next season, went 4-of-5 from the field and 2-of-2 from three for 12 points to go with three assists and a steal in 20 minutes. Wade Baldwin IV, who scored 20 points in Portland’s summer league opening victory, handed out 10 assists to go with seven points, eight rebounds and two steals in 24 minutes Sunday versus the Hawks. Caleb Swanigan finished with five points, eight rebounds and five assists in 25 minutes and Zach Collins added eight points, seven rebounds and five blocks in 20 minutes before leaving the game in the second half with a right ankle sprain. Collins, who had his 2017 Las Vegas Summer League cut short due to injury, said he didn’t think the injury would keep him from playing in Tuesday’s game, though that is still to be determined. The Hawks were led by John Collins, who went for 18 points and nine rebounds in 25 minutes. No other Hawks player scored in double figures. Next up, the Trail Blazers play their last game before tournament play versus the San Antonio Spurs Tuesday at COX Pavilion. Tipoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. on NBA TV.Trail Blazers-Hawks Box Score

The Trail Blazers are now 25-17 overall and 17-7 at home this season. Portland has now won three straight, five of their last six and seven of their last 10. The win is also the Trail Blazers’ fourth straight versus the Bulls. Despite having just 10 wins this season, the Bulls gave the Trail Blazers just about all they could handle in the first half. Chicago shot 62 percent from the field and 60 percent from three in the first quarter.And while the Trail Blazers weren’t much worse from the field, they went just 2-of-10 from three in the first quarter, which helped the Bulls go into the second trailing by just a point despite turning the ball over four times.Portland went up 10 in the second quarter, but a quick 6-2 Bulls run to end the half cut that lead to 56-51 going into the intermission.

"I think that our past few games... they’ve been teams that we’ve been able to get things that we might not have been able to get against those other teams because you’re so familiar with them, their style," said Lillard. "So I’ve just been kind of letting the game happen, just making the right plays and guys have been playing really well."From there, a 15-4  Portland run gave the Trail Blazers their largest lead of the night at 117-98 with just over five minutes to play in regulation.

"And that's what we did. A few minutes later, Terry Stotts pulled his starters and put in the rookies to ride out the remainder of what would be a 12-point victory. “We tightened up," said Damian Lillard. "I think the first half, we had some good moments but in the second half, we just tightened everything up. We started to get a few more stops. The end of the ball movement was turning into points. We kept trusting each other and we made more shots. It was good energy in the game. We got something from a lot of guys. When we get those types of efforts from so many different people, we’re going to get this type of result.”CJ McCollum had a team-high 24 points (10-14 FG, 2-4 3-PT, 2-2 FT) to go with three re-bounds and four assists.

Zach Collins had 16 points (6-9 FG, 2-3 3-PT, 2-2 FT), nine rebounds, a career-high four assist, one steal and one block before fouling out in 26 minutes.

In Tuesday night's game, we got an answer: not a damn thing. McCollum went 17-of-26 from the field and 5-of-10 from three for 40 points to go with six assists and five rebounds to help the Trail Blazers defeat the Bucks 118-103 in front of a sellout crowd of 19,512 at the Moda Center."I think I just played a complete game, I think that was the biggest thing for me," said McCollum. "Just get to my spots, live with the results and just try to make the right passes."The Trail Blazers are now 8-3 overall and 5-2 at home this season. The victory also ends a four-game losing streak to Milwaukee and ensures the Bucks won't sweep the season series for the third consecutive season."It was big, we needed it," said McCollum. "They’re a very good team, playing extremely well. Obviously Giannis (Antetokounmpo) spearheads them, they shoot a lot of threes, make a lot of threes, so it was a challenging game for us – spread out and took advantage of it. We felt like we shouldn’t have lost to the Wizards earlier on in the season and we took advantage of this game, and we want to take advantage of the rest of our homestand."While McCollum would end the game as easily the most dominant scorer on the floor Thursday night, it looked as though he might have had quite a bit of competion for that designation in the early going. Damian Lillard started the game by hitting back-to-back threes followed by McCollum, Jake Layman, Al-Farouq Aminu and Zach Collins all scoring from three before the end of the quarter.But the Bucks were also up to the task, going 6-of-12 from three and 12-of-24 from the field. So even with Lillard putting up 11 of his 13 points in the first quarter, the Trail Blazers only managed to take a 33-31 lead into the second quarter. But after a sleepy second quarter, McCollum came to life after the intermission. The 6-3 guard out of Lehigh scored the first six points of the quarter for Portland and eventually finished the third with 19 points on 9-of-11 shooting to tilt the scales in the home team's advantage."(McCollum) was unreal," said Evan Turner. "Big night. He did a great job all around, started off in attack mode. I think he started from start to finish – the first half, he did a great job, came out to start the second half, our bigs set some great screens and he got it going from there and just gave them hell."But even with McCollum's heroics, the Bucks still managed to keep it close going into the home stretch. Portland's lead was cut to five after a Tony Snell three-pointer with 7:13 to play, at which point it looked as though the Trail Blazers might have a close finish on their hands.But Portland finished the game on a 20-10 run to come away with the 15-point victory while handing Milwaukee just their second loss of the season."Really good win against a really good team," said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. "I’m really proud of the way we played. Obviously CJ was outstanding offensively. I thought Evan Turner and Farouq really worked all game long to make it as difficult as they could on Giannis. I thought the defensive job that we did as a team was the key. We did a lot of good things. CJ was the obvious thing, but I thought we made some clutch shots when Dame and CJ were on the bench to kind of keep us in the game. Evan hit a big three, Chief hit a big three, so it was a good team win."CJ McCollum led all scorers wit 40 points, the most a Trail Blazer has ever scored against the Bucks, to with with six assists, five rebounds and four steals in just under 36 minutes, joining only Clyde Drexler and Damian Lillard as players to achieve such a stat line in franchise history. It was the fourth time in his career that McCollum has scored at least 40 points.Evan Turner had his best statistical game of the season, finishing with 16 points on 7-of-12 shooting, 11 rebounds, four assists and a steal in 31 minutes, making him just the second player to post those statistics off the bench this season.Jusuf Nurkić went for 12 points, eight rebounds and six assists in 24 minutes. Damian Lillard added 13 points and six rebounds in 36 minutes and Jake Layman rounded out Portland's double digit scorers with 10 points on 4-of-9 shooting.Giannis Antetokounmpo led the Bucks with 23 points, while Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez each added 22 points. No other Milwaukee player finished with more than eight points.• The Trail Blazers shot 17-of-43 from the three-point line (39.5%) while the Bucks shot 16-of-42 from deep (38.1%).• Seven different Portland players made a three-pointer, with six players making at least two.• Portland’s reserves outscored the Milwaukee bench, 35-27.• The Trail Blazers outrebounded the Bucks, 51-42.• Portland recorded seven blocks and three steals while Milwaukee finished with two steals and one block.• Portland connected on 48 field goals (of 91, 52.7%), which tied the most field goals the Trail Blazers have made this season.The Trail Blazers host the LA Clippers Thursday night in the fifth game of a six-game homestand. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.

But sometimes, such as Thursday night versus New Orleans, reverting back to being a team that wins almost entirely with offense works, too.On a night where neither team was playing their best at the defensive end, the Trail Blazers made 18 three-pointers to defeat the Pelicans 132-119 in front of a crowd of 18,921 at the Moda Center.“In some ways, this was a frustrating game," said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. "We never really got on track defensively. The offense was good all night. A lot of good performances offensively, but defensively, for whatever reason, a lot of it might have been New Orleans playing really well, but I’m glad we strung together some stops in the fourth quarter and we were able to pull away."Portland is now 6-2 overall and 3-1 at home this season and have won three-straight, a milestone they didn't achieve until late November last season.With Pelicans power forward/center Anthony Davis sitting out Thursday night's game with a sore elbow, one might have expected the Trail Blazers to easily dispatch a New Orleans team playing on the second night of a back-to-back.But Pelicans forward Julius Randle had other ideas. The fifth-year forward out of Kentucky, who signed as free agent this offseason with New Orleans, went 4-of-5 from the field and 6-of-6 from the free throw line in the for 14 points in under six first-quarter minutes. "That’s what we’ve grown accustomed to seeing because I think he’s very capable of that," said Pelican head coach Alvin Gentry of Randle. "I thought he took the ball and was very aggressive with it, I thought he ran out and did some things in transition that were really good."Behind Randle's bully ball, the Pelicans shot 52 percent from the field in the first quarter, but the Blazers were even more efficient thanks to their three-point shooting. In a harbinger of things to come, the Trail Blazers would shoot 6-of-9 from three in the first quarter to take a 35-31 lead after the first 12 minutes. Randle stayed hot in the second quarter, scoring nine points on 3-of-4 shooting from both the field and the free throw line, while E'Twaun More went 4-of-5 from the field for 10 points. But Portland stayed hot from deep, with Seth Curry, Damian Lillard and Al-Farouq Aminu combining to go 4-of-6 from three in the quarter to help Portland take a 70-65 lead into the intermission. "Guys who practice threes, if you’re open, it’s a good three," said Stotts and as evidenced by eight Trail Blazers making at least one triple Thursday night. "Caleb (Swanigan) practices them, Zach (Collins) practices them, Nurk practices them, so if they’re open and uncontested, it’s a good shot... I don’t think they’re out there searching, I thought it was within the rhythm of the game."Portland's three-point accuracy waned in the third, though Jusuf Nurkić made up for the dip in team percentage by going 4-of-4 from the field, including a three-pointer, and 1-of-1 from the line for 10 third-quarter points. But Nikola Mirotic would do nearly the same, scoring 10 points on perfect shooting from the field, to negate the advantage and cut Portland's lead to 102-99 going into the fourth quarter. But between Portland's improved defense and New Orleans perhaps feeling the effects of playing the night before versus the Warriors, the Trail Blazers held the Pelicans to 35 percent shooting from the field and less than 30 points in the quarter for the first time Thursday night. They also managed to make 11-of-19 shots from the field and 5-of-9 three-pointers, with two of those coming from Zach Collins, to outscore the Pelicans by 10 in the quarter to come away with the 13-point victory. "We shot 50 percent from three or over 50 percent from three and I think a lot of that has to do with the quality of looks that we got," said Lillard. "Even I got a few really good looks from three and I feel like my shots always come off the dribble and contested. But they had some coverages where they were showing and they were doubling on the post sometimes and the defense was coming from the weak side, and a lot of times, just a matter of guys being available and in the right spots, then guys actually executing and making the right play, making the right pass. I thought a lot of times we did that tonight.”Damian Lillard led the Trail Blazers with 26 points (7-16 FG, 4-7 3-PT, 8-8 FT) to go with seven rebounds and six assists.Jusuf Nurkic scored 20 points on 7-of-9 shooting (1-1 3-PT, 5-6 FT) to go with nine re- bounds and two assists. It was his second straight game with 20-plus points.Al-Farouq Aminu scored a season-high 17 points (6-11 FG, 2-5 3-PT, 3-3 FT) to go with 10 rebounds and one block. It was his second double-double in the last three games and his third of the season.Nik Stauskas scored in double figures for the third straight game, finishing with 10 points (4-6 FG, 2-3 3-PT) and three assists.Julius Randle led all scorers with 29 points on 9-of-16 shooting from the field and 11-of-12 shooting from three to go with six rebounds and three assists in 26 minutes. E'Twaun Moore finished with 19, Nikola Mirotic put up a double-double of 18 points, 13 rebounds and Jrue Holiday added 17 points on 5-of-14 shooting. • The Trail Blazers scored a season-high 132 points. It was the most points Portland has scored since a 137-105 win over Golden State on Feb. 19, 2016. • Portland made a season-high 18 three-pointers (of 35, 51.4%). The Pelicans shot 27.6% from the three-point line (8-of-29). • The Trail Blazers outscored the Pelicans on the fast break, 16-6. It was the most fast break points Portland has scored this season. • Portland outrebounded New Orleans, 46-44. • The Trail Blazers bench finished with 50 points. It was the third time this season that Portland’s bench scored 50-plus points. The New Orleans reserves had 51 points. • Portland assisted on 26 of its 44 field goals. It was the most assists the team has had this season."We had good defensive games against Indiana and Houston, tonight not so much. So it’s always going to be a point of emphasis, we can’t take our defense for granted on games we’re scoring a lot of points, which is having mental discipline to do that.” -- Terry StottsThe Trail Blazers begin their first all-home back-to-back since 2013 by hosting the Los Angeles Lakers Saturday night at Moda Center. Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.




“Disappointing, kind of a crazy game,” said Trail Blazers head coach Terry Stotts. “I thought we had a good flow, good momentum for most of the game. Seems like we had little stretches where the turnovers weren’t bad, but we had them in bunches. Their offensive rebounds were pretty much under control, but they got them in bunches. Those runs, I thought, effected us and allowed them to have the lead.”Portland is now 22-17 overall and 14-7 at home this season. The Trail Blazers had won their both their last six games versus the Thunder and their last eight at home to the Northwest Division rival before Friday night’s loss. After the first half of Friday night’s contest, it looked as though the Trail Blazers had a great chance to extend their streak against the Thunder behind strong performances from Damian Lillard and Jusuf Nurkic. Lillard put up 13 points on 5-of-9 shooting from the field while handing out five assists in 17 first-half minutes, while Nurkić followed up his historic performance two nights before in Sacramento with 16 points on 8-of-9 shooting, four rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block in 15 minutes. Add in Jake Layman, playing meaningful minutes for the fist time in over two weeks, going 4-of-5 from the field for nine points in seven minutes, and Portland took a 62-57 lead into the intermission. But the fact that the Trail Blazers played a great first half, with the team shooting 52 percent from the field and only turning the ball over six times for five Oklahoma City points, and only lead by five at the half was a sign of things to come in the second half. So too was Thunder forward Paul George going for 21 points in the first half.Oklahoma City chipped away at the lead for the majority of the third, finally  taking their first lead since early in the first quarter at 86-85 on a Paul George three with 1:51 to play in the quarter. Portland would take the lead back, but Oklahoma City finished the quarter on a 10-2 run, helped along by back-to-back turnovers from Damian Lillard, to take a 93-87 lead into the fourth quarter. After trading baskets for the first half of the fourth, the Thunder took their largest lead of the night at at 107-97 after a Westbrook 18-footer with 4:13 to play in regulation. The Trail Blazers had one last push left, going on a 10-2 run, with all of those points coming from the free throw line, to cut the Thunder lead to 109-107 with 42.8 seconds to play. Westbrook missing a mid-range jumper on the ensuing possession, with Al-Farouq Aminu grabbing the rebound and giving the Trail Blazers a chance to tie or take the league with just over 22 seconds to play. Aminu would get another rebound, this one on the offensive end, after Lillard missed a runner with 11.3 seconds to play, to give CJ McCollum a chance to send the game to overtime. But McCollum’s long two pointer missed short and Oklahoma City corralled the rebound with 4.3 seconds to play.“It was a late run," said Lillard. "We needed to probably make every shot and get every stop. Those are tough situations to come back from and we just came up short. We had plenty of opportunity, I missed one of my last of those three free throws. We still had another chance, I came down and missed a floater off the glass. With everything that happened and how hard we made it for ourselves, we still had an opportunity at the end of the game, just didn’t come up on the right side of it."All that was left was for George to make two free throws to officially put the game away, which he did for his 36th and 37th points of the night. "I liked the way we came back," said Stotts. "We had two good looks to tie the game late. We didn’t make enough plays. I thought we could have made a few more plays that we didn’t make."Jusuf Nurkic finished with 22 points (9-14 FG, 4-6 FT), eight rebounds, three steals and one block. It was the fourth time in the last five games that he has scored 20-plus points. Damian Lillard led Portland with 23 points (7-19 FG, 1-8 3-PT, 8-9 FT) to go with eight assists and two steals. He has scored 20-plus points in six of the last seven games. Al-Farouq Aminu had his sixth double-double of the season, recording 16 points (6-11 FG, 2-5 3-PT, 2-2 FT) and 15 rebounds to go with two assists. It was the sixth time in his career that Aminu has had at least 16 points and 15 rebounds in a game. Jake Layman led the Portland bench with 11 points (5-7 FG, 1-2 3-PT) to go with one re-bound in 12 minutes. It was the fourth time this season he has scored in double figures. CJ McCollum finished with 10 points on 4-of-15 shooting (2-6 3-PT) to go with two re-bounds and five assists. Paul George scored a game-high 37 points (10-23 FG, 5-9 3-PT, 12-14 FT) to go with eight rebounds, two assists and one steal. George has scored 30-plus points in six of his last eight games. Russell Westbrook recorded 31 points (13-28 FG, 0-2 3-PT, 5-6 FT), nine rebounds, seven assists and one steal.

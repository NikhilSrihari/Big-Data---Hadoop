DENVER – The Celtics aren’t the only ones noticing that their offense has been anemic inside the paint. Opponents are honing in on that fact, too.Prior to tonight’s matchup with the Nuggets, Denver head coach Mike Malone pointed out to the media – unprompted – that Boston ranks last in the league in points in the paint with an average of just 35.3 per game. That number is far and away the worst in the league, with the next-lowest average coming in at 42.3 per game (Houston and Memphis).Brad Stevens touched on that fact prior to Monday morning’s shootaround at the Pepsi Center. He noted that his team’s paltry interior scoring isn’t a new issue.“Last year we were not very good either,” he said. He added, “That’s been an issue for us for the last 18 months. Prior to that we were pretty good at it. So we’ve just got to keep hammering on it, see if we can get a little better.”Stevens dove deeper into those issues prior to tip-off. He explained that the Celtics don’t necessarily need to change their offense; they just need to improve upon certain nuances of the offense that lead to interior scoring opportunities.“I do think that we need to be better at cutting,” he said. “Just a little bit more alert to being quicker with our drive decisions on quick swings, making a point of getting the ball quickly to the ground and to the rim and then read from there.”Asked later if the C’s don’t have the guys on the roster to accomplish that goal, Stevens answered briskly, “I think we have enough.”Certainly, Boston has plenty of players who can put pressure on the defense off the bounce. Kyrie Irving is one of the best in the league in that area, and he averaged 11.6 driver per game last season. Meanwhile, Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown averaged 10.1 and 6.1 drives per game, respectively, last postseason. This season, Irving’s average has dropped to 7.7 per game, and Tatum and Brown have each dropped to 5.8 per game.The Celtics need those players, as well as others, to improve in that area in order to begin to generate interior scoring. They must also be alert to the defense to find cutting opportunities when they are off the ball. To their credit, Stevens did comment that he has seen improvements in such plays of late.“We’ve been good the last few games once we’ve gotten there about spraying it and then making the next right pass,” he said. “We’re just not getting there quite enough. Hopefully we will tonight.”Boston certainly has the ability to get into the paint; it has just yet to unlock that ability this season. A pleasant stat of which the C’s should take note is that they scored an average of 44.0 points per game in the paint last season against the Nuggets. Both of these rosters are largely the same as the ones that squared off last season, so it’s obvious that Boston has the ability to accomplish its goal tonight.However, this time around, Denver is clearly honing in on the fact that the C’s have struggled to generate points in the lane. That fact will make doing so even a heftier challenge as these two contenders meet for the first time this season.- Marc D'Amico
PHOENIX – The Boston Celtics have seen Deandre Ayton on tape. Now it’s time to see him on the court.Boston will face off with Ayton, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 Draft, for the first time tonight in Phoenix. The 7-foot-1 center has opened his career by averaging 15.9 points and 10.9 rebounds per game through his first 10 games.The level at which Ayton has played has garnered strong reviews, and that trend continued with Brad Stevens prior to tip-off. Boston’s coach was asked about what he has seen from Ayton on film, and all he did in response was rave about the rookie.“He’s a special talent,” said Stevens. “Skilled, knows how to play, is huge in there, so he’s great rolling and ducking in. Plays above the rim but can also pass. Again, skilled from the perimeter. He’s a heck of a player, as you would assume that the first pick would be.”A heck of a player, but also a unique player who presents a unique challenge to the C’s. Ayton is different than the two centers Boston has faced thus far on its five-game road trip, Myles Turner and Nikola Jokic.“I think going from guys like Myles Turner, who is a really skilled offensive player that’s pushed his range out to the 3-point line but blocks shots, to Jokic, who is one of the best passers in the game and makes plays for himself and others, now to Ayton, who can do a little bit of both of those things, I think that every night the challenge changes a little bit,” said Stevens. “But he brings everything to the table that you would think a really good player at that position brings.”There are a number of Celtics who will learn that first-hand tonight for the very first time in the NBA. The challenge will first be presented to Al Horford, and then to the likes of Aron Baynes and potentially Robert Williams.It’s time for the C’s to see what this year’s No. 1 overall pick truly brings to the table.- Marc D'Amico
SALT LAKE CITY – There’s big news tonight regarding Gordon Hayward: he will play in his first back-to-back of the season.OK, the real story is that he’s making his return to Salt Lake City, where he left during the summer of 2017 to join the Celtics, but the back-to-back aspect adds a twist to the game.“This is kind of the litmus test,” Brad Stevens said of tonight’s game, “is the second night of a back-to-back at the same level he’s been playing. So (he) should be about the same, somewhere in that 23 to 26-minute range.”That’s good news for everyone in the building, because no one wanted Hayward to miss another potential return to the arena he used to call home.It’s well-known at this point that Hayward suffered a dramatic injury during the first game of last season. He missed 11 months before being cleared for full-contact basketball, which delayed his return to Salt Lake City. He has played all but one game this season for Boston, but this one will unquestionably be a bit different.On this night, Hayward will be exposed to the true feelings of Salt Lake City’s fans, who were angered by the forward’s decision to leave and sign with the Celtics. Hayward will also see plenty of familiar faces throughout the night, ranging from Utah’s head coach, Quin Snyder, to security guards in the hallways.“I think obviously he spent seven great years here and it meant a lot to him and his family,” Stevens said. “Without question, there’s going to be extra emotions that go into that for him. The best that we can, you focus on what you can control and go from there. I think it would be not human to not recognize that there will be extra emotions attached to this.”Stevens said he expects Hayward to “handle it fine” as he works his way through the night’s emotions. The other lingering question revolved around what Hayward will bring to the table for Boston while he is on the court.Hayward enters tonight’s game averaging only 9.9 points per game on 40.0 percent shooting. He averaged at least 16.2 PPG for four straight seasons before joining Boston, so he clearly has not returned to his All-Star form. Stevens said it’s on him and the coaching staff to get Hayward in better positions to look like his old self.“I think one of the things that we’ve got to do a better job of as a group is put all of our guys in position to be more successful within their strengths,” the coach said. “He brings a lot of strengths to the table off of general actions and off of pick-and-rolls, where he can be a playmaker for others, as well as himself. I think early on we’ve done a decent job, but I think we can do a lot better as a staff.”Stevens made sure to note that no one within Boston’s organization assumed that Hayward would pick up right where he left off before his injury.“We didn’t expect this to be an overnight thing,” Stevens said.On the contrary, what Stevens, Hayward and the Celtics do expect is for tonight’s game to be an emotional rollercoaster as the forward makes the return to the building he called home for the first seven years of his career.- Marc D'Amico
BOSTON – Most NBA players returning from injury will be placed on a minutes restriction for a handful of games as they work their way back into game shape. In Al Horford’s case, who returned from a knee injury in late December, the Boston Celtics have opted to be a bit more cautious in their approach.Horford missed seven consecutive games from Dec. 8 to Dec. 21 after being diagnosed with Patellofemoral pain syndrome in his left knee. He returned to action against the Milwaukee Bucks on Dec. 23 and has not missed a game since. During that time Horford’s minutes have been monitored. The team has tried to cap his minutes to a max of 25, and the only time he has gone over was when he played 30 during Boston’s Christmas Day game against Philadelphia that went into overtime.Ahead of Wednesday night’s matchup against the Indiana Pacers, Brad Stevens announced that Horford’s restriction has gone up slightly to about 27 or 28 minutes."Obviously (it’s OK) if he goes 29 or 26, whatever the case may be, but we just don’t want to backlog 36-minute games back-to-back-to-back-to-back, one after another with him coming off of the knee (injury),” Stevens said ahead of tip-off at TD Garden. “He’s already played now eight straight after that, so he feels good and he looks good.”Boston employed a similar restriction on Marcus Morris last season. The veteran forward missed the first eight games of the 2017-18 campaign with a sore knee, and came back to a minutes restriction that lasted him from early November all the way through mid-January.“By March, Morris felt great and really played well toward the end of the season,” Stevens pointed out. “So it’s a fairly similar plan.”Horford’s body seems to be responding well to the limitation, as his per-36 numbers have been exceptional upon his return. Over the past eight games, he has averaged 17.2 points, 9.4 rebounds and 7.0 assists per 36 minutes all while shooting 56.3 percent from the field and 47.6 percent from 3-point range.- Taylor Snow
MIAMI – Nearly 27 months after parting ways, the Boston Celtics and R.J. Hunter have paired up yet again.Hunter, a former 2015 first-round pick of the Celtics who was later waived in October of 2016, signed a two-way contract with Boston Thursday afternoon. Hunter and his former coach, Brad Stevens, are both ecstatic about the reunion.“It’s been a journey since I last was in a Celtic jersey, and for them to give me another chance means everything to me,” Hunter wrote Wednesday in an Instagram post. Stevens, while speaking ahead of Boston’s Thursday night matchup with the Heat, said, “It’s a neat story … The stories that I’m most fond of are the stories where guys have to take a step back and really work their way to get back into it. Kudos to him for doing that.”Hunter rejoins the Celtics and the team’s G-League affiliate, the Maine Red Claws, after spending the last two seasons in the G-League with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers and the Erie BayHawks, respectively. His play there, where he shot a combined 36.6 percent from long range over two seasons, is what caught the attention of the Celtics.“On the offensive end, if he’s making shots, he’s a really hard guy to guard,” Stevens said, “because he’s, I think – his best attribute offensively is passing off actions. And so the shot-making really opens that up, and he’s been making them for the last two years.”Hunter was also averaging a career-best 4.7 assists per 36 minutes during 22 games with the BayHawks this season.While the majority of Stevens’ comments were about Hunter’s growth as a player over the last couple of years, the coach did look back upon that fateful day in 2016 when these two parties went their separate ways. The decision to cut Hunter was not an easy one, to say the least.“I think one of the toughest things that I’ve been a part of over the last six years is when we had those 16 guaranteed contracts in the fall and we had to make a decision on one and we ultimately had to waive R.J.,” Stevens recalled. “Because we thought he was a high-upside player that had really gotten better, that was going to work hard to be better.”Hunter has done exactly that over the last two-plus years, which led him to a reunion with the team that drafted him in June of 2015. - Marc D'Amico

BOSTON, MA – Celtics forward Gordon Hayward today underwent successful surgery to remove the plate and screws that were implanted following the broken fibula he suffered on October 17. Hayward’s ankle and fibula are both structurally sound, and the removal of the plate and screws was necessary as they were causing irritation to his peroneal tendons. He is scheduled to return to basketball activities in six to eight weeks, and is expected to be at full strength for the start of training camp.Additionally, Celtics center Aron Baynes underwent successful nasal septoplasty surgery for a nasal fracture he suffered during Game 6 of Boston’s Eastern Conference Finals series against Cleveland. Baynes is expected to return to basketball activities in two to four weeks.

The Boston Celtics announced today that guard Kyrie Irving will tomorrow undergo a minimally invasive procedure to alleviate irritation in his left knee. Further information will be provided following tomorrow’s procedure, and the team will have no further comment until that time.

The Boston Celtics announced today that they have signed 10-time NBA All-Star and 19-year veteran Paul Pierce to a contract, enabling him to retire as a member of the organization with which he spent his first 15 NBA seasons.“We’re honored that Paul has chosen to retire as a Celtic. He is among the very best Celtics – a champion on and off the court,” said Celtics governor and managing partner Wyc Grousbeck. “We congratulate Paul on a Hall of Fame career, and look forward to seeing his number raised to the rafters of TD Garden.”"It's an honor to have this opportunity to once again call myself a Boston Celtic," Pierce said. "The organization and city took me in and made me one of their own, and I couldn’t imagine ending my career any other way. I’m a Celtic for life.” Drafted by the Celtics with the 10th overall pick of the 1998 NBA Draft, Pierce’s 15 seasons in Boston from 1998-99 to 2012-13 trails only John Havlicek (16) for the most ever spent in a Celtics uniform. He produced 21.8 points (44.7% FG, 37.0% 3-PT, 80.6% FT), 6.0 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 1.44 steals and 36.6 minutes in 1,102 career games (1,099 starts) in the green and white.Pierce’s name will forever be a constant throughout the Celtics’ all-time leaderboards. The California native tops the franchise lists in three-point field goals (1,823), free throws (6,434) and steals (1,583), while also placing as the Celtics’ second all-time leading scorer with 24,021 career points. Earning his iconic nickname “The Truth” during his third NBA season in 2000-01, Pierce also retires in the organization’s top-10 lists in games played (3rd  – 1 ,102), minutes played (3rd – 40,360), field goals (3rd – 7,882), field goal attempts (2nd – 17,630), three-point field goal attempts (1st – 4,928), free throw attempts (1st – 7,979), offensive rebounds (8th – 1,008), rebounds (7th – 6,651), assists (5th – 4,305) and blocked shots (4th – 668).Pierce’s knack for postseason success further cements his legendary status in a Celtics uniform. Boston qualified for the playoffs in 10 of Pierce’s 15 seasons with the team, ranking him seventh on the franchise’s all-time playoff leaderboard with 136 postseason games played. The crafty forward averaged 20.9 points (41.9% FG, 33.9% 3-PT, 83.4% FT), 6.4 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.32 steals in 39.8 minutes in his Celtics playoff career. Pierce – who owns the fifth most playoff points in franchise history at 2,843 – averaged north of 20.0 points in six separate postseason runs, including a playoff career-high 27.1 points over 10 games in just his second career playoff appearance in 2002-03.One of Pierce’s greatest postseason accomplishments coincides with the Celtics’ most recent NBA title in 2008. Making his first career NBA Finals appearance, Pierce followed up a 22-point performance against the Los Angeles Lakers in a Game 1 victory with 28 more points on 9-of-16 shooting (4-4 3-PT) and eight assists in Boston’s Game 2 triumph. His 38 points in Game 5 of those Finals represented his second-highest scoring total in 26 postseason games that year. Pierce produced 21.8 points (43.2% FG, 39.3% 3-PT, 83.0% FT), 4.5 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.08 steals and 38.8 minutes in that six-game series, helping the Celtics raise their NBA-record 17th championship banner and their first since 1986. Named the Most Valuable Player of that 2008 clash, Pierce became the third Celtic ever to earn MVP honors in his first NBA Finals Appearance (Jo Jo White – 1974, Cedric Maxwell – 1981).Spanning over his 19-year NBA career, Pierce averaged 19.7 points (44.5% FG, 36.8% 3-PT, 80.6% FT), 5.6 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 1.31 steals and 34.2 minutes in 1,343 games (1,285 starts) with Boston, Brooklyn, Washington and the LA Clippers. He ended the 2016-17 season as the only active NBA player with at least 25,000 career points, 7,000 rebounds and 4,500 assists.

BOSTON – The Boston Celtics announced today that they have acquired the third overall selection of the 2017 NBA Draft and the favorably-protected rights to a future first round pick from the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the first overall pick in this year’s draft.The future first round pick will be the Los Angeles Lakers’ 2018 pick if it’s within the No. 2 to No. 5 range of the 2018 draft. If it is not, the Celtics will instead receive either Sacramento’s or Philadelphia’s first round pick in 2019, whichever is more favorable. However, if either of those 2019 picks result in the first overall selection, Boston will instead receive the other first round pick.“We’re thrilled to be able to select what we expect be an impact player with the third pick in this year’s very talented draft class, while also adding a highly valuable future asset as we continue to build towards Banner 18,” said Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge.With the acquisition of these two first round picks, the Celtics now potentially own the rights to seven first round selections over the next three years, including picks from Brooklyn (2018), Memphis (2019, protected 1-8), and the LA Clippers (2019, protected 1-14).

LAS VEGAS – Marcus Smart went down Thursday night, but that fact allowed Terry Rozier to rise up.Rozier took over during clutch time of Thursday night’s game against Portland to lead the Celtics to a 91-85 victory.  He scored Boston’s final eight points of regulation to turn what was a tie ballgame into a six-point win.“The coaches believed in me.  My teammates believed in me,” Rozier confidently stated after the game.  “They gave me space to make plays, and that’s what I did.”The most important play of the stretch arrived with 44.7 seconds left on the clock.  With the score knotted up at 85-85, Rozier took possession of the ball on the left wing as the shot clocked ticked into single digits.  His defender was draped all over him but he still opted to fire up a 3-pointer that caught nothing but net to give the C’s a lead they would never relinquish.“I knew he was all up on me, but I didn’t know how much time was left,” Rozier said as he recalled the play.  “We were kind of winding down the shot clock, so I just wanted to get it up and get a high arc and it dropped.”Boston got a stop on the ensuing possession and Rozier iced the game with three free throws over the final 16.7 seconds.  He scored a team-high 19 points, including 10 during the fourth quarter.Rozier’s summer league coach, Micah Shrewsberry, couldn’t say enough good things about the young point guard following the contest.   He used the word “poise” and “maturity” to describe Rozier’s performance; those are not words that are typically associated with rookies.One thing Shrewsberry couldn’t say was that he was surprised by Rozier’s clutch performance.“I’m sure he’s had opportunities like that at Louisville before,” he said, “and that’s why he didn’t seem rattled when we called his number out of a timeout and told him, ‘Hey, we need a bucket right here.’”Rozier later gave context as to why he wasn’t rattled by the circumstances of the game.“I know I have the ultimate eye of confidence to take a shot down the stretch if a coach needs me to do it,” said Rozier.  “I’m not afraid of taking big shots and things like that.  It’s a 50-50 chance.  It might go in, it might not, but I’m not scared to take it.”Now the Celtics know that in Smart’s absence, they still have a point guard who can carry them to a win down the stretch.  Ironically, it took an unfortunate injury to Smart for Rozier’s clutch gene to show face.With Smart now out of the lineup, Rozier says that he expects his role to expand.  He does want to warn everyone, however, that they shouldn’t expect him focus solely on scoring the rock.“I’m going to find my minutes to do something really well to help my team,” he said, “whether that’s pushing the ball really fast down the court and trying to beat them up the court, rebounding at the guard spot or something else, I’m going to get in there and do it.”He sure did “it” Thursday night.  The rookie rose up during clutch time and kept Boston’s pursuit of a summer league championship alive.

WALTHAM, Mass. – Gaining and maintaining confidence is vital for a rookie as he treks through his first NBA preseason experience. Through four exhibition games with the Celtics, it appears to be an attribute that Boston rookie R.J. Hunter is not lacking in, as he has played with poise on both ends of the floor and seems very comfortable with Brad Stevens’ system.Of course, it does help that he has known his coach for a large portion of his life, as the Stevens and Hunter households have been close for many years.“Our families always knew each other and we’ve always kept in touch,” said Hunter, whose father Ron coached at Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) while Stevens was at the helm at Butler University.That relationship enabled Stevens to keep a eye on Hunter's game since he was 12 years old, and the coach has kept close track of the progression he’s made since then. Prior to Boston’s practice on Saturday, Stevens noted that Hunter’s confidence was not as evident early on in his playing career.“He was not a well-established, highly-ranked prospect as a 16 or 17-year-old high school [athlete],” recalled Stevens. “He was a guy that was trying to figure out how to be at that level. He was really thin, even compared to now, and he was really passive.”Stevens said Hunter had a ceiling, but did not scratch at it until his senior season of high school. Being a late bloomer like that takes a hit on the college recruiting process and likely the draft process as well. However, Hunter has blossomed over the last few years and continues to do so at a high rate, thanks to the poise he’s developed and the high basketball IQ that is common among coaches’ sons.On Wednesday night, Hunter saw his first action against an NBA team as the C’s faced off against the Nets for a preseason matchup in Brooklyn. He played 30 minutes in the win and filled up the stat sheet with 11 points, four assists, four rebounds and a game-high four steals.“I think he’s figuring out his spots on offense,” said Stevens. “Defensively he has some really good moments. He’s way ahead of where I thought he would be, but I think that he could still go a long way.”Hunter may have a long way to go, but the monumental strides he has made over the last few weeks provide strong indication that his work ethic should carry him to success.At the moment, the 6-foot-5 sharpshooter looks like a completely different player than the nervous wide-eyed rookie we saw during the first few games of Summer League in Salt Lake City three months ago.Hunter's confidence has grown exponentially since then, and that’s what he believes is driving his early progression.“If you tell yourself that you can play in this league, I think things start slowing down for you,” Hunter explained.His coach has had faith in him early on as well. Hunter played 51 minutes during the team’s two games in New York this past week, and Stevens threw a curveball at the rookie by allowing him to run the point during the fourth quarter of Friday night’s loss to the Knicks. Hunter said after the game that he hadn’t played point guard since middle school, but Stevens is all about experimentation during the preseason, so he tossed him out there to see how he would manage a ball handling role. Keep note, it’s unlikely we will see him run the point during the season.“I think he could definitely do it,” said Stevens, before adding with a smile that it “might be 10 years again till he does it.”On a serious note, Stevens said Hunter “really has the ability to pass in small areas, but I just wouldn’t want to put him through the stress of being a point guard and to make shots.”Though it is likely that Hunter will not run the point again anytime soon, he did have a few shining moments from the position Friday night. He looked particularly comfortable dishing to Jordan Mickey, as he assisted on both of his fellow rookie’s buckets.“I think we’ve built some pretty good chemistry,” Mickey said prior to the team's practice on Saturday. “We kind of know what each other is going to do. He’s able to find me in certain areas and I’m always looking for him. Just playing together in practice everyday has helped out a lot.”Like Hunter, Mickey also excelled during his first NBA road trip. He played 24 minutes during the two games combined, and scored 12 points on 5-of 7 shooting, collected eight rebounds and blocked three shots.Mickey said during the first couple of weeks of the preseason, “I’ve seen myself grow a lot. I’m trying not to mess up too much out here and just make the right decisions.”He’s made a lot of right decisions so far. Following practice on Tuesday, Stevens said the second round pick was “dominant” during the session and was the best player on the court. However, Stevens noted both Hunter and Mickey have a long way to go and will “have some ups and downs” along the way.But they are progressing quickly so far, and the confidence they are displaying at this point is promising.

NEWPORT, R.I. – Brandon Bass remembers when the transformation began.  It wasn’t necessarily expected, but it was absolutely needed.It was mid-March of last season, when Kevin Garnett went down with a bruised left thigh.  Garnett, who was the safety valve and leader of Boston’s defense, was forced to miss 12 of the final 17 games of the regular season.The Celtics were built on defense.  That’s how they won games.  They operated as a cohesive unit thanks to extraordinary communication and teamwork.  Garnett was the man who was responsible for all of those traits.With their star big man sidelined, Boston’s defense would crumble, said many.  There was no way that the team could execute its difficult defensive scheme without the presence of Garnett’s voice.  Bass, who has been known mostly for his smooth jumper during his eight-year career, thought otherwise.“When he went down, I just felt it was right for me to step up and fulfill his role the best way I could,” Bass remembers.And so the transformation began.Brandon Bass the shooter became Brandon Bass the communicator.  He could be heard from the TD Garden stands barking out defensive calls to his teammates on the perimeter.  If the Celtics were an orchestra, he became their conductor.Many of Bass’ teammates and coaches lauded his efforts during Garnett’s absence, particularly former head coach Doc Rivers.  Rivers constantly noted publicly that Bass not only embraced the role of communicator, but he also excelled at it.Rivers wasn’t the only one who took note of that success.  Bass did, too.  He realized the impact that his communication made and he has taken that lesson into the first two days of Celtics training camp in Newport, R.I.“This year I can be myself, and I think that being vocal and more of a defensive-minded player is something I’ve grown into,” Bass said.  “I think I’ve got to be the one who just takes that first step in leadership on defense and being vocal and just having a defensive mindset.”Bass’ new mindset is standing out to his teammates, particularly Avery Bradley.  Bradley is another player who prides himself on defense.  Harassing offensive players is what he does best, and that’s why he was an NBA All-Defensive Second Team selection last season.Bradley was pinged twice by reporters on Tuesday about how different things will be on defense without the presence of Garnett.  Bradley seemed miffed by the questions and immediately pointed to Bass as the more-than-capable heir apparent to Garnett’s role.“I wouldn’t say that,” Bradley quipped after a reporter stated that most of the team’s top defenders are on the perimeter.  “Brandon Bass helps out a lot on defense.  He’s a great defender, believe it or not.  He picked up a lot of stuff from KG and he helps everybody out.  He’s like the veteran for the bigs and he’s been talking them through everything.”Next, Bradley was asked if there was more pressure on the guards because Garnett is no longer waiting behind them.“No, not at all,” Bradley stated.  “Like I said, we have Brandon Bass and he’s going to continue to talk to everybody and make sure we’re all on the same page.”As the new leader of the pack on defense, Bass believes that his teammates are gracefully accepting his communication and leadership.“Everybody is responding,” Bass said after Wednesday morning's practice.  “Everybody is like a sponge out there right now.  These next several days are going to be about everybody absorbing as much as possible.”While his teammates absorb Bass’ words of wisdom, the rest of us should acknowledge how valuable he is to this team.  He’ll still swish home those patented mid-range jumpers, but he’ll also be the leader of this defense.“If you look at when KG was here, it rubbed off on Brandon,” Bradley told Celtics.com.  “Now it can rub off from Brandon to other guys.”It's funny how things work.  KG transformed Bass, and now it’s time for Bass to transform his new teammates.

WALTHAM, Mass. – Following his Draft workout at the Boston Celtics practice facility Thursday afternoon, Maxie Esho walked around the perimeter of the adjacent media room while his competition was being interviewed by a flock of reporters.He was inquisitively examining photos from the Celtics’ 2008 NBA Championship run. For the recent University of Massachusetts graduate, it was a trip down memory lane.“It’s a lot of history,” said the 6-foot-8 forward. And having attended prep school in New England prior to his four-year career at UMass, it’s history that he’s quite familiar with.“He’s one of the coolest guys I’ve met from the NBA,” Esho recalled with a laugh.Esho’s favorite part of the event was when Garnett spontaneously took the group out into the street to meet the Boston faithful.“We walked out in the street,” said Esho, who originally hails from Maryland. “Out of nowhere a crowd of people just started following. It wasn’t a script, nobody knew about it, and we were just passing out T-shirts. You could feel the love that the Boston fans have for their team here.”Esho’s journey through high school, at Lee Academy in Maine, and college, in Amherst, has now brought him full-circle; it’s only fitting that his first Draft workout was with the team he is so familiar with.Like KG, Esho brings a lot of energy and passion to the game. For three seasons at UMass, he was the main spark off the bench and was a regular on SportsCenter’s top 10 for his high-flying alley-oop finishes. This past season, he earned a starting role for the Minutemen and averaged 11.3 points and 6.4 rebounds per game.One of Esho’s best performances came last November at the Garden against Boston College, when he scored a game-high 23 points and corralled nine rebounds during a win.He felt strong about the majority of his workout Thursday, though he was forced to stop early after taking an elbow to the head.He can’t help but ponder what it would be like if given the opportunity to return to the Garden, this time donning green and white. “I guess you could say it would be a New England dream,” said Esho. “I went to prep school here … college. It’d be crazy.”Just a senior at IMG Academy (Brandenton Fla.), he is the first player since 2005 to declare for the NBA Draft without college, overseas or NBA Development League playing experience.Despite Singh’s lack of experience, director of player personnel Austin Ainge liked what he saw out of the big man.“He’s a little raw, but he actually shoots the ball really well,” said Ainge, who jokingly referred to Singh as a “stretch five and a half.”“And he’s not just tall, he’s also thick,” continued Ainge. “He’s humongous.”It’s that size that initially earned Singh a scholarship offer from IMG.  His friends and family back home saw his potential and encouraged him to pursue a basketball career.“Everyone said, ‘Because you have good (height), good hands, your skill is good; you have to play in the NBA,’” said Singh. “So I said ‘OK, I’ll go try to do my best over here.’”He received no collegiate scholarship offers, so he decided to enter the Draft this spring.Ainge believes the 19-year-old has “a bright future” and is “an interesting prospect.” Only time will tell.
BOSTON – If Gordon Hayward’s New Year’s resolution was to enhance his explosiveness, then he’s off to a great start.The Boston Celtics opened the 2019 portion of their season Wednesday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves, and Hayward pulled all of his scoring tricks out of the bag during a season-high 35-point performance that helped pave the way to a 115-102 win at TD Garden. As you can see from his shot chart on the right, Hayward was scoring from all over the court against the Wolves. After missing his first two shots of the game, he went on to make 14 of his final 16 attempts, including 4-of-6 from 3-point range.What we are mostly going to focus on is that cluster of green dots below the basket. That’s where Hayward showed his greatest signs of improvement.The most notable struggle for Hayward, post-ankle surgery, has been his ability to burst to the basket. He’s made gradual progress with that as time has gone on, scattering a handful of explosive rim runs throughout the campaign, but nothing like he showed Wednesday night.Hayward continuously blasted from the top of the arc to the cup with ease, which opened the door for him to create numerous opportunities for himself and for his teammates. His aggressiveness led to a season-high three dunks, after tallying just four during his previous 32 games combined.The first play that we’ll take a look at wasn’t one of those dunks, but it still effectively displays Hayward’s improved lateral and downhill quickness.Late in the second quarter, Hayward finds himself matched up against Wolves forward James Nunnally at the top of the arc. Al Horford comes over to set a pick on Nunnally, of which Hayward curls around before lowering his shoulder and driving toward the cup. Nunnally is able to dodge the screen and actually does a great job of sticking with his man, but Hayward is able to adjust to the strong defense by pulling up and creating separation with his legs. He hangs in the air before banking an easy bucket off the glass.Thirty seconds later, Hayward delivered one of his most promising baskets of the season.Here he finds himself in the same exact scenario against Nunnally. Once again, Horford sets a screen, only this time Nunnally runs right into it. This creates an open lane for Hayward, who curls around the pick and takes off toward the basket, before throwing down the rock with both hands.Here’s a look at the same play from a different angle. Watch the explosion after his second dribble.Hayward also displayed his ability to find space and make intelligent off-ball cuts Wednesday night. Early in the third quarter, Al Horford is fed the ball at the top of the arc while the C’s are orchestrating transition offense. It appears he’s about to rise up for a 3-point shot, but then he recognizes that both Josh Okogie and Karl-Anthony Towns are closing out on him at the same time. Hayward sees the same thing, which creates a better option. That option is Hayward cutting to the rim from the backcourt. He catches Horford’s eye, Horford delivers the ball just as Hayward kicks into a higher gear, and then Horford watches as his teammate soars through the air for another two-handed slam.Scoring wasn’t the only method that enabled Hayward to show off his improved burst against the Wolves. He also used it to help create opportunities for his teammates, as he dished out five assists on the night.Here, during the first quarter, Hayward curls around staggered screens set by Marcus Morris and Guerschon Yabusele, receives a hand-off from Yabusele, and turns the corner toward the hoop. His aggressiveness draws the attention of four Minnesota defenders. As soon as the defense collapses upon him, Hayward hooks a pass over to a wide-open Morris, who splashes home a triple.Later on, we see Hayward use his burst in a similar manner to set up an alley-oop pass to Horford.After the game, Hayward acknowledged that he’s noticed a great difference in his lateral quickness from the start of the season to now.“It’s so much better than it was (at the beginning of the season),” Hayward told ESPN sideline reporter Doris Burke as he was doused by his teammates in a post-game Gatorade shower. “I think it’s pretty close to where it was (before the injury).”So, keep your eyes peeled for a more explosive and a more aggressive Hayward in 2019.
WASHINGTON – The Boston Celtics filled their final roster spot Thursday afternoon by signing veteran big man Greg Monroe.The acquisition of the 6-foot-11, 265-pound center should give Boston a major boost in the rebounding department, as well as a solid scoring option off the bench.“I think that's a great pickup for us," said Celtics forward Marcus Morris. "He’s a player who knows how to play the game. He's been around the league awhile, so I think he'll add to our size down low, (and add) scoring.”Monroe became available  Feb. 1 when he and the Phoenix Suns agreed to a contract buyout. The 27-year-old played only five games with the Suns this season, having been previously dealt from the Milwaukee Bucks in early November. Monroe played in a total of 25 contests between Milwaukee and Phoenix this season, boasting averages of 10.4 points per game, 7.4 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game, all while shooting a career-best 60.1 percent from the field and playing 21.8 minutes per contest.Over the course of his eight-year NBA career, Monroe has established himself as a top-notch rebounder on both ends of the floor, as well as a serious low-post scoring threat. He has put up career numbers of 13.9 PPG, 8.7 RPG, 2.3 APG and a 51.4 percent shooting clip from the field during his time in Detroit, Milwaukee and Phoenix. He enjoyed an impressive five-season stretch from 2012-2016 during which he averaged 15.6 PPG and 9.5 RPG.The No. 7 overall pick of the 2010 NBA Draft should be able to help carry Boston’s second-unit offense thanks to his burly, physical presence that couples nicely with a strong set of post-up skills.“He's a big body," said Morris. "Even if he's not scoring, he's carving space for other guys to be able to drive. He's well respected around the league so that goes a long way. I think he's going to be a great piece for us going forward."Another benefit of having Monroe on the Celtics is that the team no longer has to face him. He has been a matchup nightmare for Boston throughout his career, having averaged 15.6 PPG, 9.2 RPG and 2.5 APG during 26 appearances against the C’s.Monroe has also proven that he is capable of stepping up in the Playoffs. He was a major contributor off the bench for the Bucks last postseason, as he averaged 13.2 PPG and 7.3 RPG, while playing 23.5 MPG.Leading up to this year’s Playoffs, the Celtics will do their best to integrate Monroe and get him used to their system so that he can potentially help boost the team on a lengthy postseason run.“That’s always a challenge,” admitted coach Brad Stevens, “but I think that’s something that, any time you’re in this business, you get used to being on your toes and making sure that you’re able and you’re ready to do those types of things.”Boston will start the process of integrating Monroe immediately, as he is expected to be available to make his Celtics debut tonight against the Washington Wizards at Capital One Arena.

BOSTON – Kyrie Irving, just eight days removed from left knee surgery, walked crutch-less Sunday afternoon into TD Garden to cheer on his Boston Celtics for the first game of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinals matchup against the Milwaukee Bucks.Many fans and members of the media were surprised, not just to see the rehabbing point guard in the arena, but to see him walking around without a noticeable limp and without any type of assistive walking device.It turns out, they weren’t the only ones who were shocked. Even C’s coach Brad Stevens raised an eyebrow at Irving’s mobility as he entered the packed venue to watch the Celtics take Game 1 over the Bucks, 113-107.“The first time I saw him, when I saw him the other day he was walking around, I was surprised too,” Stevens recalled Monday afternoon in a conference call with the media.Irving underwent season-ending knee surgery April 7 to remove two screws in his left knee that had been inserted after he broke his patella during the 2015 NBA Finals. The All-Star point guard had previously undergone surgery March 24 to remove a tension wire in the knee in order to relieve some discomfort that he had been experiencing throughout some of the season. However, it was later discovered that the remaining screws developed a bacterial infection that would call for another procedure and force him to miss the remainder of the season.It will likely take Irving four to five months to recover from the operation, but seeing him up and about and back on the sideline so soon after the procedure was uplifting for Stevens.“I had just got done literally 10 minutes ago talking to our training staff and the people who are working most closely with him, and they feel great about his early [progress] a week in, or whatever it is,” Stevens said during the call. “That’s exciting, that’s encouraging. Again, he’s going to make a full recovery. Now that the screws are out and now that you see his early progress, it is very good.”In the meantime, Irving can still contribute to the team by being present on the sideline and offering support. Even if he’s not on the floor, Irving’s presence alone is enough to give Boston a boost. He, along with fellow injured teammates Marcus Smart and Daniel Theis, were three of the loudest, most encouraging fans in the building Sunday afternoon, as they helped guide their teammates to a Game 1 win. "No matter if you are playing or not, it is about camaraderie," said Celtics big man Greg Monroe. "When you see your teammates cheering for you, it gives me extra energy and I am pretty sure it has that effect on other people also."Irving has also been lending a helping hand off the court. His replacement, Terry Rozier, paid him a visit two days before Game 1 to seek advice ahead of his first postseason start. Judging by the result, the visit seems to have paid off well.“He made me feel comfortable,” said Rozier, who tallied 23 points, four rebounds and three over 40 minutes Sunday afternoon, while leading the C’s to an overtime win. “He’s a great guy, and whether it’s basketball talk, whether it’s joking around, he’s great at engaging with guys. He’s a great leader, and I know for a fact, even if I hadn’t reached out to him, I’ve got him in my ear. I’ve got him in my corner.”The rest of the Celtics can say the same. Irving should be in their corner – at the end of Boston’s bench at TD Garden – for the remainder of the Playoffs. Nothing – not even the fact that he’s just barely more than a week removed from surgery – will stop him from supporting his teammates from the sideline, as they look to make a lengthy postseason run.
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics produced a multitude of remarkable team performances throughout the 2017-18 season, giving us plenty of options to choose from for our Game of the Year award. There was the Game 7 win over Milwaukee in the first round of the Playoffs, the 22-point comeback victory over Philadelphia in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals, and the plethora of buzzer-beating victories to all take into consideration. However, there was one Celtics game that stood above them all – the stunning, 26-point comeback win against the Houston Rockets on Dec. 28 at TD Garden.During a season that was chock full of comeback wins, this was by far the most impressive when taking into consideration the massive deficit and the nail-biting drama that the matchup entailed. That’s why we’ve chosen it as our Game of the Year.Ironically, this contest had all of the makings of being the Worst Game of the Year, judging by how it started out for Boston. Playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Celtics came out sluggish, falling behind 32-12 by the end of the first quarter. By halftime, they trailed 62-38. Boston’s deficit reached as many as 26 points during the third quarter and its win probability dropped to as low as 0.4 percent, according to ESPN.com.Then suddenly, the C’s flipped a switch on both ends of the court.Boston outscored Houston 24-9 during the final 7:26 of the third quarter, limiting the Rockets to just one field goal make during that span.The run helped cut the C’s deficit down to single digits by the start of the final frame, and they rode that momentum straight to the finish line for a 99-98 win.The comeback in and of itself was improbable, but the way it unfolded during the closing seconds of the game is what made it a finish for the ages.Fresh out of a timeout and trailing 98-95 with 11.6 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Boston had the opportunity to tie up the game for the first time since the opening tip-off.Instead, the C’s opted to go for a quick 2-pointer, as Marcus Smart fed Jayson Tatum for a cutting dunk to hack their deficit down to one point with 7.3 seconds remaining.This meant the Celtics would need another turn of fortune in order to pull of the win. And who better to deliver one than the king of winning plays himself?As Houston set up to inbound the ball following Tatum’s dunk, Smart draped himself all over James Harden, knowing that the pass would likely go to the Rockets’ superstar who had gone 15-of-15 from the free throw line to that point.In a desperate attempt to get open, Harden threw his left elbow into Smart’s chest, sending the Celtics guard flying to the floor for an offensive foul.“We were just trying to deny him the ball,” said Smart, who had held Harden scoreless on seven shot attempts throughout the game. “When you get up in him and you give him only one way to go, it’s hard; it becomes frustrating … We were trying to make it real uncomfortable for him the whole night, and he just lost it and gave me a little nudge.”The Celtics, out of timeouts, quickly inbounded the ball to Al Horford in the post. The veteran big man went to work on Tarik Black, before sending a hook shot through the hoop with 3.7 seconds to give Boston a 99-98 advantage – its first lead of the game.Houston still had ample time left to get off a game-winning attempt, so the Celtics needed to buckle down and get one more stop. Guess who came through again?Smart glued himself back onto Harden, attempting to bait the eventual league MVP into committing another charge. Sure enough, Harden’s right arm connected with Smart’s chest, and it was déjà vu all over again.Boston took back possession of the ball and inbounded to Horford, who was promptly fouled with 2.0 seconds remaining. Horford missed his first free throw and intentionally missed the next to decrease Houston’s probability for a potential game-winner.Eric Gordon pulled down the rebound off the second miss and launched a 75-foot Hail Mary, but the shot caromed high off the top of the backboard to put a seal on one of the most improbable comeback wins of the NBA season.
BOSTON – Long-range shooting was not considered to be one of Jayson Tatum’s specialties in college. During his lone season at Duke, the 6-foot-8 forward connected on 40 of his 117 attempts for a 34.2 percent clip, while thriving mostly from midrange.Once he got to the pros, however, something suddenly clicked for Tatum beyond the arc. Three-pointers started falling at a record-breaking pace, and at just 19 years old, he quickly became one of the feared shooters in the game.By season’s end, he was a shoo-in for our Sharpshooter of the Year award.Tatum wasted no time in his transition to the NBA 3-point line. Through his first 10 games, he connected on 15-of-29 long-range attempts for an eye-popping 51.7 percent clip.The sudden surge was turning heads around the league, but Tatum was not surprised by his start because he had been persistently grinding away to improve that area of his game.“I worked on it day-in and day-out, trying to get drafted as high as possible,” Tatum said after an early-season win against the Milwaukee Bucks. “I was working on the things that people said I couldn’t do well and shooting 3s was one of them.”Some pundits thought it was beginners luck, but Tatum’s rate didn’t drop at all through the first two months of the season. By Game 33, he was still shooting 51.5 percent from deep – good enough to lead the entire league.Tatum experienced a slight midseason dip, but never quite hit the “rookie wall.” He finished off the campaign with a team-leading and franchise record 3-point clip of 43.4 percent, while also establishing a Celtics rookie mark with 105 3-point makes.Tatum’s long-range percentage was also the fourth-highest rookie mark in NBA history among players who made at least 100 treys, placing him behind D.J. Augustin, Stephen Curry and Wesley Person.Certainly, it was one of the greatest transitions a player has ever made from college to the pros.With that being said, Tatum’s teammates and coaches saw from the beginning how great of a shooter he could become because of his prowess from midrange. They just had to convince him to step back a few feet and help him build the confidence to let it fly from beyond the arc.“We would play pick-up games in September and he was just abusing people in the midrange,” said veteran teammate Al Horford. “He’d just post the ball, shake and raise, and all that. But I think coach was kind of like, ‘No, we want you to get out there and shoot the 3s and save those (midrange shots) for end-of-the-clock-type shots.’”That advice paid off, and Tatum went to have one of the greatest rookie shooting seasons in NBA history.The scary thing is, C's coach Brad Stevens believes Tatum’s development in that area is just beginning.“For a guy with his frame, he shoots it effortless,” said Stevens. “I mean, he’s going to be able to shoot it deeper, and he’s going to be able to make it off running once he gets a little bit stronger, more used to it, and everything else. He’s going to be a heck of a shooter.”In one season, Tatum has already established himself as a heck of a shooter, and a record-breaking one at that. And that’s why he’s our Sharpshooter of the Year. 
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics have already plowed through their first 10 games of the season with a 6-4 start. Along the way, they have displayed plenty of promise in some areas, while also showing that there is still room for substantial improvement in others.Ten games is a small sample size to judge, but these first few weeks of the regular season have revealed a few early patterns that could factor into the team’s ultimate identity. So, here is what we’ve learned so far about the 2018-19 version of the C’s.The Celtics’ defense has opened up the season right where it left off last spring: atop the NBA rankings.While offensive numbers have skyrocketed across the league, Boston has remained steadfast on the defensive end, allowing an NBA-low 101.3 points per game. That number is remarkable considering that 18 teams are scoring at least 110 PPG, including seven of Boston’s first 10 opponents.The key for the Celtics has been their perimeter defense. Opponents of Boston are shooting a league-low 29.6 percent from 3-point range, which has helped the C’s hold their foes to a field goal percentage of just 42.2 percent.Boston’s length and versatility present a frustrating combination for opposing offenses, and that has allowed the team to continue to set the bar defensively.While Boston’s defense has been second to none this season, its offense has told a different story. The Celtics have been inconsistent on that end of the court to start the season, leading to an offensive rating of 103.5. Only three teams in the NBA have tallied a lower number thus far.The good news is that most of Boston’s offensive struggles came during the first five games of the season, when the team was just beginning to form its chemistry.  The C’s produced a 99.2 offensive rating during those contests, but then discovered a solid rhythm during Game 5 in Oklahoma City, where they staged a 16-point, comeback win. The C’s have ridden that momentum ever since, posting a 107.8 offensive rating over their last five games, good for 17th in the league during that span.By improving its ball movement over the last few games, Boston has been able to establish a stronger offensive flow that it started out with. And although the team still ranks near the bottom of the league on that end of the floor, it is at least showing signs of growth.One trend that has stood out on the offensive end has been Boston’s high-volume of 3-pointers. The Celtics are tossing up 36.7 triples per game, increasing last season’s rate by 20.8 percent. Only Houston and Milwaukee have attempted more deep balls per game.Boston is sinking 12.9 of those long-range attempts per game, which, if maintained, would be the highest average of makes in franchise history. The team already penned a new single-game franchise record Nov. 1 when it knocked down 24 treys against the Milwaukee Bucks, smashing its previous mark of 19, while falling just one shy of the NBA's all-time single-game mark.The Celtics have admitted, however, that they rely too much on their 3-point shooting at times. More than 37 percent of their scoring production has come from beyond the arc, while only 35.3 percent of their points have come from within the paint. Boston hopes to round out its offense by driving to the hoop more often, which could also help them create more contact at the rim. In doing so, the team would raise its sub-par free-throw rate, which, at 19.0 attempts per game, is on pace for the lowest average in franchise history.Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving both showed signs of rust at the start of the season, but that should be expected for two players who went several months without playing competitive basketball.Hayward has averaged 10.1 PPG through his first nine appearances, which is less than half of his scoring average from his 2016-17 All-Star campaign. However, it’s important to remember that he went nearly 11 months without playing 5-on-5 basketball following his season-ending ankle injury last October. It takes time to regain trust in one’s body after such a serious injury, and Hayward is going through that process right now, while also playing on a 25-minute restriction. Still, he has shown glimpses of his former self, like when he scored 18 points against Milwaukee last week to help Boston beat the previously undefeated Bucks.Irving, who underwent season-ending knee surgery in March, also displayed some initial signs of rust upon his return. The five-time All-Star averaged just 14.0 PPG on 39.1 percent shooting from the field and 24.1 percent shooting from 3 during the first six games, but it appears as though he’s turned a corner. Irving scored 28-plus points during three of his last four games, all while shooting 60 percent from the field and 56.3 percent from deep during that span.For Hayward, returning to form may take a bit more time than it would for Irving, given that he missed roughly twice as much time. In the meantime, it’s vital to remain patient and to trust the rehab process, because Hyaward still possesses all of the tools that made him into an All-Star two seasons ago.If an opposing offense gets off to a hot start against the Celtics’ starting five, then there’s a good chance that it will hit a brick wall once the second unit comes in.Stacked with defensive studs like Aron Baynes, Marcus Morris, Semi Ojeleye, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart and Daniel Theis, Boston’s “Bench With Attitude” is a force to be reckoned with.The leader of the group has been Morris, who also happens to be the person who coined the BWA moniker. The eight-year veteran is off to the best start of his career, posting averages of 14.7 PPG and 6.9 RPG, while shooting 51 percent from the field and 49 percent from deep.Most of Boston’s reserves have the talent to be starters on other teams, and many of them have been in the past. But they have all expressed willingness to make sacrifices for the betterment of the team, knowing that this group has a unique level of talent and depth to make a long postseason run.
BOSTON – How have Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum, two 21-and-under wings, proven this season that age is just a number? The answer lies in the presence of two of their teammates.In Al Horford and Kyrie Irving, the Celtics have two four-time All-Stars who approach their on-court and off-court lives as basketball players in a truly professional manner. That type of example, as Dallas Mavericks head coach Rick Carlisle pointed out earlier this season, can make a profound impact on young players like Brown and Tatum.“When you pair really good talent with really good leadership on teams,” Carlisle said before facing the Celtics on Nov. 20, “guys get better faster.”There is no better example of that fact than in Boston, as Brad Stevens and Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski recently discussed on Coach K’s radio show on SiriusXM.Stevens had just completed a meeting with Tatum before calling in to Coach K’s show Tuesday afternoon. Boston’s coach revealed the message that he had relayed to the 19-year-old rookie just moments before.“I just told him, ‘You need to think about how special it is to be great every night,’” Stevens said. “It’s just different. It’s just different, and there’s not many guys that can do it. And you have to appreciate the guys that can.”In other words, Jayson: appreciate Al and Kyrie, and take note of how they got to where they are today.Stevens said he relays similar messages to all of Boston’s young players, including Brown.Coach K, in watching Horford from afar and after coaching Irving (and Tatum) for a year at Duke, agreed with the premise of Stevens’ message, which directly correlates with what Carlisle said in mid-November.“You have two of the really brilliant – not smart – players, and talented (players), with Kyrie and Al,” Coach K said.Their leadership abilities are on par with their on-court skills as well, and that’s critical both to the success of the Celtics and to the development of Boston’s young players.Horford is a seasoned leader, and he has been such for more than a half-decade, beginning with the Atlanta Hawks and carrying over to his first two seasons with the Boston Celtics. He does everything in a professional manner, from his eating habits, to his work ethic, to his family life and community work off the court.“I don’t think you could have a better veteran to lead,” Stevens said of Horford, “because he is consistent in his approach, he doesn’t waste his time, he doesn’t mince his words – when he speaks, it’s worth listening to because he doesn’t talk a lot – and he always, always is about the team.”Not all rookies come into the league with an “all-about-the-team” attitude. Heck, some agent-player combos have steered themselves away from the Celtics in the last two drafts because they were more about their individual opportunity than they were about the success of the team that was drafting them.Brown, Tatum and the rest of the young Celtics (there are 11 total who are 25 or younger, discounting Irving) see the way Horford goes about his business, and it’s infectious.The same can be said for Irving, who requested a trade from the Cavaliers this past offseason with the assumed intention of being able to step into a leadership role. In Cleveland, LeBron James was the leader, and Irving was in the shadow. In Boston, Irving is side-by-side with Horford, working in tandem to set the bar for Boston’s team on a daily basis.“My feeling is that Kyrie has become a better leader, quicker, because he feels it’s more on him,” commented Coach K.Stevens then gave his insider perspective on what Irving has given the Celtics from a leadership angle.“The thing that I’m really appreciative of is he has really, really tried to just be one of the guys, and I think that has been good,” Stevens said. “He treats everyone from our equipment staff, training staff, coaching staff, players, PR staff, all the same. Players, whether they’re 30 or 19, he treats them all the same.”That is unique in the NBA. That instills belief in young players that they belong, and it shows them that they should never place themselves on a pedestal and look down upon their own teammates, regardless of how successful they may become.“Win, lose or draw,” Stevens added, “he comes back the next day to work, and he’s in here every day, and he’s a pleasure to be around.”Coach K commented on what he has seen in Irving from afar.“I think he always has a strong face,” the Hall-of-Famer said before explaining. “I tell our guys all the time, ‘You don’t always speak with words, you speak with how you look,’ and I think he’s become much more vocal, but he really has a strong leader’s face.”Krzyzewski continued, “He wanted the opportunity to expand his abilities, and they’re not just shooting and ball handling – they’re leadership-wise.”There is no doubt that Brown and Tatum have reaped the benefits of Irving’s new opportunity with the Celtics, which has been coupled with Horford’s refined leadership abilities.Think about it: What would Brown and Tatum look like if they were instead on a lottery-bound team that did not have any established stars in a leadership role? Would they be learning the right way to approach their day-to-day life? Would they be able to watch, in person, how special it is to be great every night?In Boston, they have all of that, as Stevens and Coach K outlined, and that’s a big reason why Brown and Tatum are proving that age is just a number if you’re in the right situation.
LAS VEGAS – The Celtics saw potential in Jabari Bird when they drafted him 56th overall in the 2017 NBA Draft and then signed him to one of their very first two-way contracts. Now, as Bird plays for the Summer Celtics as a restricted free agent, the rest of the league is witnessing some of that potential budding into legitimate talent.Bird was the best player on the floor Saturday night, as the Celtics fell 82-69 to the Denver Nuggets. The second-year wing scored a game-high 24 points on 9-for-17 shooting. He drew oos and ahhs from the crowd with many of his dazzling finishes in the paint, which, from a hang time perspective, were on par with the likes of the great Michael Jordan.“I mean I idolized MJ growing up,” Bird said with a big smile after being asked about his athletic, MJ-esque finishes. “I watched all of his highlights when he was with the Bulls. He’s just somebody I’ve tried to mold my game after a little bit.”Bird wasn’t on MJ’s level Saturday night, and he’s unlikely to ever reach such heights, but he was unquestionably the best player on the court while Boston and Denver battled it out.This performance was no flash-in-the-pan effort by Bird, either. As Summer Celtics head coach Jay Larranaga said after Saturday’s game, “Jabari has done that in NBA games, at the end of the season … He’s an excellent cutter. He’s an excellent shooter.”He showcased those skills – and then some – Saturday night.Bird earned every point that he scored against Denver. This wasn’t a performance during which he simply capitalized on open shots; instead, this was a performance during which he was creating his own offense off of the dribble and via off-the-ball cuts before finding a way to finish in traffic in the paint.Bird, who played all of last season under a two-way contract with the Celtics, is currently a restricted free agent. He said that he is not worrying about that status and is instead concentrating on enjoying the moment and capitalizing on his opportunity to don the green and white in Vegas.“Just try to have fun with it, that’s the main thing,” said Bird, who is always a ball of positive energy. “I’ve worked hard all summer, I’ve worked hard all my life, and I’m just trying to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves on the court. And I’m just thankful to be with a great organization right now, and they’re letting me showcase my skills.”While Bird has looked great on offense during two Summer League games, having averaged 19.0 points per game, Larranaga sees an opportunity for improvement. That growth will be earned at the defensive end, the coach explained.“He’s growing as a defender, which I think is going to be the next big step for him,” said Larranaga.Expanding on the topic, the coach soon added, “We talk to the group a lot about efficiency. I think in the media and in the league you hear a lot about offensive efficiency and field goal percentage and all of that, but I think defensive efficiency in how you defend the court, how many steps does it take you to stunt at a shooter. And then also just in the preparation of knowing what your opponent is trying to do and knowing his best [ability] is something everyone can get better at.”Bird’s future growth at the defensive end may help him to earn a role in the NBA. For now, his offensive game is what’s doing the talking in Vegas, and it’s making the Celtics look like geniuses for snagging the athletic and talented wing at the tail-end of last year’s Draft.
LAS VEGAS – Jabari Bird gave the Celtics hope Saturday night, but he couldn’t give them a win all by himself.Boston fell 82-69 to Denver despite Bird’s stellar offensive night that featured a game-high 24 points. Bird shot 9-for-17 from the field, good for 52.9 percent, but the rest of the team converted on only 37.0 percent of its shots.“The harder playing team usually wins,” said Boston’s head coach, Jay Larranaga. “They played harder than us.”The Nuggets pulled away over the final 14 minutes of the game after the two teams went back and forth throughout the first three-plus quarters. After leading by only three points with 3:34 left in the third quarter, Denver gained the first double-digit advantage of the game when it pulled ahead 56-46 with 2:18 remaining in the third.The Nuggets’ lead ballooned all the way to 16 points during the fourth quarter while Boston’s offense sputtered and they cashed in on 10 of their 21 shots.“As a group I felt like we over-dribbled a lot and dribbled ourselves into tough situations,” Larranaga explained after the loss. “So we’ve got to keep the ball off the ground and we’ve got to move it to the second side more than we did tonight.”Boston managed to total only 14 assists and 26 made field goals during the game. This was after it tallied 18 assists and 38 made field goals during Friday night’s win over Philadelphia.Bird was the only member of the C’s who scored in double-figures. Pierria Henry logged the team’s next-highest scoring total with nine points.Bird’s performance, however, was a bright spot for the C’s amid an otherwise ugly night on offense. He scored in a variety of ways, from cutting off of the ball for open layups, to generating quality shots off the dribble, to scoring from the free-throw line. No other player in the game scored more than 19 points.“I’ve worked hard all summer. I’ve worked hard all my life. And I’m just trying to take advantage of the opportunities that present themselves on the court,” Bird said after the game. “And I’m just thankful to be with a great organization right now, and they’re letting me showcase my skills.”Boston would have loved to have seen its other heralded players log successful nights as well, but those players were quiet against Denver. After scoring 16 points apiece during Friday’s win, Guerschon Yabusele (seven points) and Semi Ojeleye (three points) combined to score only 10 points Saturday night. They combined to shoot 3-for-12 from the field against Denver.Meanwhile, first-round draft pick Robert Williams, who exited Friday’s game with a left knee contusion, did not play.The Nuggets were led by second-year guard Malik Beasley and DeVaughn Akoon Purcell, who scored 19 points apiece. Beasley notched 11 of his points during the opening quarter, while Akoon Purcell poured in 15 of his points during the second half.Boston now stands at 1-1 after two games in Las Vegas. It will have Sunday off before returning to the court at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday night, when it will take on the Charlotte Hornets.
LAS VEGAS – Two days after scoring only 69 points against the Denver Nuggets, Boston returned to the court and exploded into triple-digits for a 100-80 win over the Charlotte Hornets Monday evening in Las Vegas.The Celtics nearly matched Saturday’s scoring total through three quarters Monday, as they dropped 68 during the first 30 minutes of action. The offensive surge was keyed by balanced contributions from both the starters and the bench.Jabari Bird and Jarrod Uthoff led the charge for Boston with 16 points apiece, but they had plenty of company in the scoring column. Seven different Celtics scored in double-figures, including four starters and three reserves. Guerschon Yabusele and Semi Ojeleye were right on Bird’s and Uthoff’s heels with 14 and 13 points apiece, respectively. Pierria Henry also scored 13 points, while Hassan Martin added in 12 and Trey Davis scored 11.“I thought we played very unselfishly,” head coach Jay Larranaga said of the balanced attack. “I thought we shared the ball.”That trend started from the opening jump, as the Celtics tallied a whopping 30 points to go along with five assists during the opening frame alone. Charlotte, meanwhile, scored only 20 points during the first quarter.Boston’s dominant play was maintained throughout the contest, which featured only one lead change. It led by as many as 13 points during the opening frame, by as many as 15 points during the second and third quarters, and by as many as 20 points during the fourth quarter. The final advantage of 20 points matched the largest lead of the night.Larranaga said that his team watched film of its missed opportunities from Saturday night, and learned from what it saw.“We had so many extra-pass opportunities in Game 2, and we watched those, and watched how [few] times we challenged people at the rim,” he said. “Tonight we hardly ever did that, so I’m happy with the progress we made.”Charlotte couldn’t handle the sharp Celtics offense, and it couldn’t score at a consistent clip, either. The Hornets made only 38.1 percent of their shots during the game, including a woeful 9-for-31 effort from long distance.The contrasting efficiency of the two teams prevented the game from ever truly being in the balance. The final moment at which Charlotte had any hope of a win was when it cut the Celtics’ lead down to seven with 1:10 remaining in the third quarter, but Boston answered by scoring the next five points to regain control of the game from there on out.The Celtics now stand at 2-1 on the week after completing the preliminary portion of their schedule. They scored at least 95 points during each of their victories, but scored only 69 during their lone defeat.The NBA Summer League’s preliminary round will be completed Tuesday, which Boston has off. Once the preliminary round is complete, all 30 teams will be seeded for tournament play, which begins July 11. As such, Boston’s next opponent, game date and game time are all to be determined.
LAS VEGAS – Very rarely does a Summer League matchup reach “juicy” territory. Thursday’s looming showdown between the Celtics and the Knicks, however, is as juicy as an In-N-Out burger off The Strip.There’s the Atlantic Division history between the two organizations. There’s the fact that the Knicks are trying to build toward where the Celtics already are. There’s the win-to-move-on aspect of tournament play.But the key ingredient to the juiciness of this impending game is the matchup between Boston’s defensive specialist, Semi Ojeleye, and New York’s high-scoring wing, Kevin Knox.Ojeleye, whom the Celtics drafted 37th overall during the second round of the 2017 NBA Draft,  is coming off of a rookie season during which he was an important contributor to a team that reached Game 7 of the Eastern Finals. He averaged 15.8 minutes per game during 73 regular-season appearances and even started three playoff games.The role he was asked to fill during his rookie season was to alter the game with his defensive versatility, and to make open shots. He did the former at a very high level.Ojeleye is regarded by many, including Brad Stevens, as a player who can reach elite status at the defensive end of the floor. As Stevens said Monday evening of Ojeleye, “His ability defensively to keep the ball in front of him is excellent – it’s highest-level.” Still, there is room for growth. In that respect, Thursday’s matchup against Knox, the ninth overall pick in this year’s Draft, will provide a challenge to Ojeleye that he has yet to see during this year’s Summer League. Knox entered Wednesday, an off day for both teams, as the league’s third-leading scorer with an average of 23.3 points per game. He’s coming off of a 29-point performance against the top seed in the tournament, the Los Angeles Lakers.Knox’s game has opened many eyes, including those of Celtics Summer League head coach Jay Larranaga, who is already well into prep mode for Thursday’s matchup against New York.“He’s what the future of the NBA is,” Larranaga said of Knox. “A very long, athletic, skilled player that can play multiple positions. Can shoot the ball, can drive it, he’s getting to the foul line a ton. So being able to show our hands and not foul him on his driving situations will be really important.”That last part is the challenge of which Ojeleye will be facing. The 6-foot-7 forward wants to stay in front of Knox by using the skills that he showcased this past season, but he also wants to pressure the ball in the manner Stevens will be seeking next season.From Ojeleye’s perspective, that is a tightrope he will learn to balance as he faces off with Knox Thursday afternoon for the very first time.“You have to feel it out,” said Ojeleye, who is well aware of Knox’s offensive aggressiveness that has led to an average of 7.3 free throws per game in Vegas. “Sometimes too much pressure is bad, but then backing off makes him too comfortable. So you have to feel it out during the game.”Ojeleye went on to explain his overarching goal as he heads into the premier matchup.“I think at the end of the day, you just want to make him take tough shots,” he said. “Guys are going to make tough shots, and if you can force him to take contested ones, that’s all you can do.”That’s what Ojeleye and the Celtics hope to do Thursday afternoon, but attempting to do so will unquestionably be their toughest challenge to this point during Summer League play.Knox has arguably been the most impressive player in the league thus far. The Celtics, meanwhile, led by the defensive prowess of Ojeleye, have been one of the best defensive teams in the league thus far.That’s, folks, has the makings of a juicy matchup – one we all get to take a bite out of at 4:30 p.m. ET Thursday afternoon.
BOSTON – Most of Brad Wanamaker’s playing time this season has come near the tail end of games, of which the Boston Celtics are either up big or down big. So, the rookie combo guard was admittedly shocked Friday night, when Brad Stevens called his name less than nine minutes into the first quarter in a closely contested battle against the Dallas Mavericks.“Honestly, I was like, ‘What? What?! WHAT?!’” Wanamaker recalled after the game with a chuckle. “But I just tried to go out there and do the right things, make the right plays and keep the guys going.”He couldn’t have made much greater of an impact right off the bat.The Celtics were leading the Mavs, 26-23, with less than a minute remaining in the first frame, when Wanamaker suddenly caught fire. He personally helped to create eight points during the final 54 seconds of the quarter, feeding Gordon Hayward with an assist on a jumper and then knocking down back-to-back 3s of his own to give the C’s a 34-23 lead heading into the second. “Just making that first shot calms you down and keeps you on your toes a little bit,” said Wanamaker. “You’re just hoping for more.”So, Stevens gave him more – more playing time, that is – and plenty of it.Wanamaker ended up logging eight points, four assists and three steals in 22 minutes of action. All of those were season highs. He shot 3-of-6 from the field, 2-of-2 from long range, corralled a pair of rebounds and turned the ball over just once, all of which helped to propel an injury-ridden Celtics team to a 114-93 win.On top of his offensive production, Wanamaker also played solid defense. He primarily took on the responsibility of guarding J.J. Barea, who logged 20 points and eight assists during the last meeting between these teams on Thanksgiving weekend.This time, Barea was held to just six points and two assists, largely because of Wanamaker’s strong, tenacious effort to keep him in check.All of this was new to Celtics fans, when, in reality, Wanamaker has been playing like this for several years. He spent the last seven seasons playing overseas, where he collected piles of accolades.Wanamaker was on three championship-winning teams while playing overseas, for two of which he was named Finals MVP. He was also a two-time Turkish League All-Star, a two-time German Basketball Bundesliga All-Star, and he earned the 2016 German BBL MVP while playing alongside Celtic teammate Daniel Theis on Brose Bamberg.The 29-year-old gave up all of that international glory this past summer by signing his first NBA contract with the Celtics. He knew he would likely see his role reduced quite a bit in doing so, but that didn’t stop him from pursuing his lifelong dream. Taking such a path has earned Wanamaker great admiration from C’s coach Brad Stevens.“This is a guy that probably turned down a ton of money playing overseas to get a chance to play in the NBA for the first time, and doesn’t get to play and has never been through that in his life where he doesn’t get to play,” said Stevens. “So, you’re really, really happy for him.”Stevens wasn’t the only one.“I was ecstatic for him,” said fellow guard Marcus Smart. “To see him get in there… that guy, he comes into practice every day. He works not knowing if he’s going to play or not. But he comes in with a great, positive attitude every day. So, to see him finally get in there and get some minutes, get a great sweat going and knock down shots, it’s something that this team enjoys watching.”Wanamaker hopes that Friday night's breakout performance leads to more playing time in the near future. “I’m just trying to stay mentally prepared,” he said. “I’m getting a lot of feedback from my family and friends, they’re saying, ‘Just stay ready.’ They’ve seen the story many times where guys don’t play, and then the second half of the season the coach finally starts calling your number. “Tonight was my time. He called me and I just tried to do the best I could do.”
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics have been in a helping mood over the past week at TD Garden. On Wednesday night, they dished out a season-high 34 assists against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Two nights later, they one-upped that performance with a 35-dime effort against the Dallas Mavericks. Then on Monday night, they took their passing game to an even higher level, handing out 37 helpers against the Brooklyn Nets for their highest assist total since dishing out 37 against the Orlando Magic on Jan. 27, 2017.The theme of assists has brought about another trend over the last three games: blowout wins.Boston mauled the Wolves, 115-102. It galloped past the Mavs, 114-93. And finally, it swished the Nets, 116-95.“We’re moving the ball, moving the bodies, just trying to create opportunities for one another to make it easier,” said Kyrie Irving, who contributed six assists Monday night. Such offensive cohesion wasn’t consistently present during the first couple months of this season, but the C’s say that their developing chemistry is allowing them to find a better rhythm as a unit.  “The beginning of the year wasn’t so kind to us, and we fixed it,” said Marcus Smart, who led the game with seven dimes. “We still have a lot of work to do, but it’s going in the right direction. And it’s been fun for us. Everybody’s enjoying it, enjoying the process of working and getting better.”Added Marcus Morris, “I think a part of learning to play together, that’s just something that’s going to come.  But if the ball is moving, I think everyone is going to get enough opportunities to do what they do to make the defense collapse.  We just find the right guy, get it to him.  It’s easy basketball.” Over the last three games, the Celtics have assisted on a whopping 79.1 percent of their made field goals. That is nearly 14 percentage points higher than Philadelphia’s league-leading mark for the season.What has helped Boston to achieve such a high rate is that it is playing what Stevens refers to as “point-five basketball.” This is when a player, upon receiving a pass, will take no more than half a second to decide whether he’s going drive it, shoot it, or pass it off again.“We’re trying to get better at executing, playing together, reading things that are options in transition, playing faster while doing that – and while hopefully taking care of the ball, which we did at times tonight,” said Stevens. “If we continue to prioritize playing together, we should get better.”Another positive that comes with playing point-five basketball is that allows all players to get involved in the passing game. That was reflected in Monday night’s box score, as six different Celtics dished out four or more assists, while no one handed out more than seven.“Guys are moving the ball at an exceptional rate,” said Smart. “We’re scoring it, we’re getting to the spots where we want to be, and everybody is feeling happy.”Boston will look to keep the ball moving Wednesday night against an Indiana Pacers team that has surrendered 30 assists in each of its last two games. Who knows, maybe the C’s will establish another season-high passing mark in the process.
BOSTON – Jaylen Brown has always taken a patient approach to basketball. That’s because his patience always pays off.The 22-year-old wing has employed that mindset more than ever this season, as he’s faced the challenge of adapting to a reduced role with the abundantly talented Boston Celtics.At first, Brown struggled to adjust, as his efficiency dipped from the previous season. However, over the last month, he has made the most out of his opportunities while serving as a key cog for Boston’s second unit.Against the Pacers Wednesday night, Brown came off the bench and logged a game-high-tying 22 points on 7-of-12 shooting to help lead the C’s to a 135-108 win at TD Garden. It marked his sixth occasion reaching the 20-point mark in his last 16 games, after not logging any such efforts during his first 19.“I’m just adapting,” explained Brown, who also logged seven rebounds and three assists during 28-plus minutes of turnover-free basketball against Indiana. “We’ve got a lot of players, a lot of guys out there, so it’s just about trying to figure out who you are and where you fit into this team, and it’s going to continue to change. You’ve just gotta be patient, continue to work hard, and everything will fall into place.”Things have changed quite a bit for the third-year wing since his sophomore campaign. Last season, Brown started every game he played in, including 19 postseason contests in which he played 32.4 minutes per game while scoring an average of 18.0 points. The returns of both Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving this season caused Brown’s minutes to drop down into the mid-20s, which at first made for a challenging adjustment period.Brown shot 39.8 percent from the field and 25.3 percent from long range through his first 19 games in a starting role, before being moved into the second unit at the start of December. Since then, his shooting numbers have skyrocketed to 50.6 percent from the field and 35.8 percent from long range.Brown’s per-36 numbers have also been excellent during the last 16 games, as he has averaged 19.9 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists and 1.5 steals per 36 minutes.“On offense, he’s starting to find himself,” said teammate Al Horford. “He’s starting to feel more comfortable. We all are with the way we’re playing. We all understand where our shots are going to come from, the type of shots that coach wants from us, and being aggressive going to the basket. So, I just think that as a unit we’re starting to understand how Coach wants us to play.”Horford added that a role change can be difficult for anyone, but Brown’s adaptation has been particularly inspiring.“He’s handled it really well,” the veteran big man said. “What I’ve noticed is that he’s really trying to figure out how he can be efficient and how he can make an impact.”There are several aspects that Brown has improved upon over the course of the season in order to become more efficient in the time he’s allotted. “Stronger cuts, better passes, better offensive decisions,” Kyrie Irving listed off. “It’s just things that you’ve got to mature as a player being on a great team … It’s tough for any young player, especially coming in and they have the expectations. But Jaylen’s doing a great job of just taking it all in, adjusting the best he can and learning from all of the veterans ahead of him.”Most of all, Brown has done a great job at remaining patient as he’s adapted to his new role. Just look at how it’s paid off.
MIAMI – Thursday night may have been the most intriguing night of the season for the Boston Celtics, and that notion has little to do with the fact that they fell 115-99 to the Miami Heat.Beyond the score were three storylines that surfaced, which ranged from a superstar keeping the lights on for after hours in Miami, to a once-in-a-lifetime moment with an idol, to a seldom-used rookie making a not-so-rookie impact.See? Told ya. You’re intrigued – far more than you were by that score.So without further ado, let’s dive right into Thursday’s stories beyond the score.Kyrie Irving, still dressed in his game outfit (sans the jersey) 50 minutes after Boston’s loss to Miami, was addressing the media in front of a white board in Boston’s locker room when, to everyone’s surprise, the lights suddenly turned off.“You shot the lights out in practice,” a reporter cleverly quipped.In a way, Irving did, and not during the game.Moments earlier, Irving entered the locker room in his game garb and revealed to reporters that he immediately went to Miami’s practice court to get a workout in following Boston’s 115-99 defeat. Although he shot 10-for-19 from the field and led all scorers with 22 points, the night just didn’t feel right to Irving, and he felt the need to change that.“I just want to feel good about my jump shot,” the five-time All-Star said. “The shots that I missed tonight were very makeable ones. And the shots that I did take tonight – I just wanted to feel good about it. That’s all.”Irving presumably went to the practice court with his individual coach, Jerome Allen, who was seen exiting Boston’s locker room right when Irving began speaking to the media, which was far after the rest of the coaching staff had exited the building.Irving went on to explain what he worked on while he was out on the court.“Just kinda imitating things that the defense was doing to me tonight, the pressure they were putting on me,” he revealed, before adding that he hit better than 90 percent of his shots. “And like I said, situations that I didn’t take advantage of.”Irving said that he would rather be in the gym working out than be out in the nightlife of Miami. He also suggested that the brief workout will allow him to sleep with a clear mind when he puts his head to the pillow tonight.“Just good to get some shots up, relieve some stress a little bit,” the point guard stated. “And after a tough loss on a back-to-back, it’s just good to see the shot go in a little bit. It’s just therapeutic.”Terry Rozier has always been very clear when discussing his idol. It has been, and always will be, Dwyane Wade.Wade is in his final NBA season and has created a ritual where he swaps his game jersey with opposing players following most, if not every, game. Rozier wasn’t interested in Wade’s jersey ending up in anyone’s hands but his Thursday night.“It was mandatory I got his jersey,” Rozier said with his uniquely wry smile. “I wouldn’t let no one else get it.”The point guard went on to give insight into the relationship he’s developed with his favorite player of all time.‘We became good friends over the last couple of years,” Rozier said. “He texted me right before the season started and wished me good luck before the season, and I told him, ‘When this day comes – when we play him today – I’m gonna need that jersey.’”Now, he’s got it. The jersey swap took place immediately after the game, and there were plenty of cameras there to catch it (as you can see up top).Robert Williams is a rookie. He’s not supposed to spark a dramatic comeback after replacing Al Horford.But that’s exactly what he did Thursday night.Boston trailed the Heat by 25 points when Williams replaced Horford with 8:14 remaining in the third quarter, and that deficit bumped up to 26 when James Johnson connected on his second free throw after Williams entered the game.Five minutes and 39 seconds later, the Celtics were back to within eight, with a real shot at grabbing a stunning comeback win in Miami.“Robert gave us a huge lift. He was excellent,” Brad Stevens said after the game. He soon added, “I mean, he gave us a chance, along with that group (with which he was on the court).”Williams was in the game alongside Kyrie Irving, Marcus Morris, Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum – the team’s other four starters. The C’s pulled to within eight and gained possession of the ball, but a missed 3-pointer by Irving, followed by a trey from Dwyane Wade, seemed to zap Boston of its Williams-led mojo.Still, that can’t diminish the impact the rookie made. His energy was infectious, and it helped Boston to outscore Miami by 15 points during his 14 minutes of action. Only one other member of the C’s had a positive plus/minus rating, and that was Morris, at plus-three.“I feel like our energy was down tonight,” he said after the game. “It wasn’t what it needed to be coming from this team. So I just tried to bring energy and get open shots for our scorers.”And, according to him, his effort worked, because the C’s looked like a different team during their 16-0 run with him on the court.“I just felt like we came together, more than anything,” Williams said of the spurt. “That’s the most I heard us talk on the court all night, even watching on the bench.”Kyrie Irving later likened Williams to a “clay figure,” one which Boston’s veterans are helping to mold into an impactful member of this squad. Thursday night, however, it was Williams who was doing the molding; he molded the game back into one the Celtics truly had a shot at winning. 
ORLANDO – Al Horford couldn’t help but to laugh at the first question he was asked following Saturday’s defeat to the Orlando Magic."Did this game kind of feel like a microcosm of your season so far, with all of the highs and the lows?" he was asked.Horford laughed, raised his eyebrows in acknowledgement and replied, “That’s pretty accurate… That’s pretty accurate.”Indeed, it was.At moments Saturday night, the Celtics looked like a top-flight team that would blow the Magic away and get back into the win column.At other times, they looked like a team with no rhythm or cohesion, and a team that was deservedly outplayed by a sub-.500 squad.Boston opened up the game with a 14-5 lead, and then built a double-digit advantage heading into halftime. That lead hovered at 12 points until the final minutes of the third quarter, when the Celtics lost their way.While Boston’s offense went stale and its defense went sideways, Orlando closed out the third period on a 14-7 run that greatly impacted the game. Not only had the Magic pulled to within five, but they had also built significant momentum against the Celtics, momentum that eventually carried Orlando to a 105-103 win.This type of up-and-down play has been the hallmark of Boston’s season. Its ability to consistently be inconsistent has truly been remarkable.  The Celtics have gone from a perplexing 10-10 start, to an encouraging eight-game win streak, to now going 7-7 over their last 14 games.No one has been able to find the answer to solve their problems, and that fact is hanging heavy over the team’s shoulders.“It’s all I think about every day, unfortunately,” said Brad Stevens Saturday night. “But it’s my job, so I’ll keep thinking about it.”From the players’ viewpoint, Gordon Hayward added, “It’s definitely a little frustrating. Puzzling is a good word.”It is a word that’s applicable because, as Kyrie Irving noted after the loss, this Celtics team is superior to most in the NBA when it comes to individual talent and ability. Most of the players in the rotation have proven themselves on the league’s bright stages.Yet, somehow, consistency has alluded this group all season long.“We have stretches where we’re really, really good, and really tough,” Hayward commented. “And we have other stretches where we’re not at all.”Horford has an inclination as to why such is the case, and although his viewpoint may sound harsh, he did not hold back from revealing it following Saturday’s defeat.“I think we play hard at times,” he said. “I don’t think that we’re playing hard enough all the time as a unit.”Two questions later, he revisited that sentiment yet again.“One thing I can say is that we have to be able to maintain that high intensity throughout the game,” said Horford. “I kinda sound like a broken record, but that’s what I see. Not consistent enough playing hard. And winning is tough. And you have to do those right things every time.”Boston has done those things sometimes, but certainly not every time. As a result, the Celtics have been forced to endure many highs and many lows throughout this season, just as they did throughout Saturday night’s matchup with Orlando that resulted in another disappointing loss.

ATLANTA – Isaiah Thomas often credits his teammates for his nightly, high-scoring efforts. Most of the time he’s not being modest; he’s simply being honest.While many of his heroic, offensive displays appear to be one-man shows on the surface, the various skill sets of his teammates truly are what allow him to be so successful night in and night out.Friday night, Thomas notched a game-high 28 points in Atlanta, including the game-winning bucket with 2.4 seconds remaining that sent the Boston Celtics home with a 103-101 win.Once again, he refused to take full credit for his terrific performance, and instead deflected it upon his peers – specifically toward Kelly Olynyk on this occasion.Olynyk had his best game of the season as he notched 26 points, eight rebounds, three assists and zero turnovers against the Hawks. But it wasn’t just the numbers that made the 7-footer so valuable Friday night; it was the fact that the Hawks were forced to respect his hot hand, which took some of the attention away from Thomas.During the early stages of the contest, Atlanta’s tenacious defense was draped all over Thomas. Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer said ahead of the game that his squad would try to do everything it could to keep the East’s leading scorer from being effective.So Atlanta double-teamed Thomas out of the gate, but that just left Olynyk wide open.“The defense they were doing,” said Thomas, “especially in the first half when they were just doubling me and keeping two guys on me… Kelly is perfect for that situation because he spaces the floor and he’s going to knock down open shots.”Olynyk responded by knocking down shot after shot, and he finished with 18 points during the first half alone.“They’re a team that’s really help-oriented,” said Olynyk. “They tried to take IT out early, tried to trap him on pick and rolls, but he was making great early passes to shooters and we were wide open.”Olynyk was one of the shooters who was being left wide open, and you just can’t do that against a high-percentage 3-point shooter and expect positive results.“I wouldn’t say they were blatantly leaving me; they were trying to help on other guys and help on IT’s drives,” said Olynyk, who shot 9-of-11 from the field, 4-of-5 from 3, and 4-of-4 from the free throw line. “But in other games, if people don’t help, he’ll have 52 (points). So you gotta do something.”The Hawks were forced to respect Olynyk’s shot during the second half. They had to keep one eye on him, and one eye on Thomas when the two were on the floor together. However, one eye on Thomas is never enough. He will go to town if you don’t double-team him, which is exactly what he did during the second half – particularly during the fourth quarter when tallied 13 points.Boston is fortunate to be loaded with offensive spark plugs, whether it’s Jae Crowder, Gerald Green, Terry Rozier, or others.Friday night it happened to be Olynyk who stepped up, and Thomas likely would not have had the game that he had if it weren’t for the 7-footer’s hot hand. “He took advantage of his opportunity, and we needed that,” said Thomas, who dished out three of his game-high nine assists to Olynyk. “We needed every shot that he made, and he played big for us.”Big games from Thomas’ teammates often translate to big games for himself. When opposing teams are forced to respect the Celtics’ other hot hands, it eases the pressure off of IT and allows him to take over a game like he did Friday night. 

BOSTON – The Boston Celtics were deeply saddened Tuesday to learn of the passing of 71-year-old legend JoJo White after a courageous bout with cancer.The former point guard, whom the C’s selected ninth overall in the 1969 NBA Draft, spent his first nine and a half seasons in Boston, averaging 18.4 points, 5.1 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game all while earning seven All-Star appearances. The Olympic gold medalist established a still-standing franchise record of 488 consecutive games played that spanned from the 1971-72 season to the 1977-78 campaign.White played a key role in leading the Celtics to a pair of championships in 1974 and 1976. He famously played 60 minutes, tallying 33 points and nine assists, during a triple-overtime win over Phoenix in Game 5 of the 1976 Finals, and later earned MVP honors for the series.White, a gifted athlete who was also drafted by the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys and the MLB’s Cincinnati Reds, had his No. 10 retired by the Celtics in 1982, and he was later enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2015.As spectacular of an athlete as he was on the court, White was an even more outstanding person off the court. The St. Louis native was an active member of the Greater Boston community, and he always wanted to be involved in Celtics events. He was hired in May of 2000 by the Celtics' front office as director of special projects, a position that he held until his passing.White impacted the lives of many players during his time in Boston, including former Celtic point guard Rajon Rondo, who happened to be in town Tuesday with his New Orleans Pelicans."I knew him pretty well," Rondo said following the Pelicans’ 116-113 overtime win at TD Garden. "He was probably one of my biggest supporters from Day 1 since I got here. He always supported me. He always gave me great advice, and his family, his wife, was very kind to me as well.”White spread kindness to every Celtics player, coach and fan that he came in contact with over the years. Former Celtics forward and current NBC Sports Boston color commentator Brian Scalabrine took some time out of Tuesday’s television broadcast to commemorate White’s genuine personality and uplifting spirit.“In 2010, before every game,” Scalabrine recalled, “he would stand at half court, give me a hug and tell me – every game – ‘You’re doing great; just continue to be who you are, and do what you do.’ That meant a lot to me.”Celtics coach Brad Stevens also had fond memories of the interactions that he had with White over the last four and a half years. "I didn't get a chance to know him real well," said Stevens, "but my times that I spent with him he was always super kind. He was always clearly really appreciative to have been a part of the Boston Celtics, and you just appreciated how he treated everybody. And when he was around, you could tell he had an influence on our guys and an impact on our guys. It's really sad. Our hearts obviously go out to the [White] family."Outside of TD Garden, former Celtics greats, including Paul Pierce and Bill Russell, took to Twitter to express their sorrow.The vast outpour of condolences spanning across several generations of Celtics basketball showed how much of an impact White had on the storied organization. His exceptional contributions on the court will always be remembered, and his gracious, kind-hearted nature off the court will be missed.
DENVER – Daniel Theis has quietly become one of the most effective role players in the NBA.The 6-foot-9 German forward, whom the Celtics quietly signed to a low-cost, high-reward deal this past June, is adjusting to the NBA game quite miraculously. He has been good, at the very least, all season, but he has been great throughout January.Monday’s game against Denver, during which the big man totaled 11 points, four assists, three rebounds, a steal and a blocked shot during only 21 minutes of action, was just the latest installment of a month-long stretch during which Theis has made an unmistakably positive impact on the Celtics.“He’s a winner,” said teammate Al Horford. “He’s playing like that, and those are the kind of guys that you want to have on your group.”Through 10 games this month, Theis has averaged 13.5 points, 11.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists, 1.6 blocks and 1.4 steals per 36 minutes. During those contests, he has shot at an efficient 57.8 percent rate from the field and 50.0 percent rate from long range. Those are outstanding all-around numbers for a role player.Theis has brought so much to the Celtics every night, and he’s a big reason why they sit atop the East with a 36-15 record.“Man, Theis is my guy. Not only what he does on the floor but off the floor,” Jaylen Brown, who hit the game-winner Monday night, said with a smile before rattling off a long list of what Theis brings to the table. “Good energy, good guy, always smiling, making jokes, great energy on the floor, what he does in the pick-and-roll in the seams, makes the right plays defensively, he battles, and he should probably get a little bit more credit for it.”He’s not flying under the radar anymore. Not with the way he’s playing.As great as Theis has been all month, he has been even better during Boston’s last seven games. He has caught a hot streak from long range, where he shot 53.8 percent during that stretch, and he made and attempted career highs from beyond the arc Monday night with his 3-for-6 effort.Theis has also become a high-level passer at his position. He dished out at least two assists during six of his last seven games, culminating with a career-best four Monday night. He had only six such performances during his first 41 games in the NBA.Theis averaged 5.2 assists per 36 minutes during Boston’s recent seven-game stretch. To put that into perspective, Horford ranks second in the league among centers with an average of 5.8 assists per 36 minutes. Theis is right on his heels.“I don’t think he’s going to be making the Larry Bird flip pass anytime soon,” Brad Stevens joked, “but he makes the right extra pass, he looks for guys, he can roll and catch it in the seam and kick it out. So he knows what to do.”The big surprise in all of this is how quickly the German big man has adjusted to the NBA. “People forget, because we’ve got JT (Jayson Tatum) as a rookie,” Brown reminded reporters, “but Theis is a rook, too.”Horford has been impressed by how seamless Theis has integrated himself into the Celtics. He was asked what has surprised him about Theis thus far, and he replied, “I just think his ability to transition to the NBA. I know that he played in a good league over [in Europe], but it doesn’t compare to coming here and having an impact.”Theis, now 25 years old, was playing overseas at age 18. He credits that experience for helping to prepare him for his first NBA season.“Maybe it’s because I played seven years professionally, so I know my role,” he said Monday night. “I know my strengths, so it’s easy for me to fit into the system. I would say that makes it easy for me.”The game has looked easy for Theis throughout January. He has become one of the most effective and efficient role players in the league, providing the Celtics with reliable play at both ends of the court on a nightly basis.“One of the best things you can be called in this league is consistent,” said Stevens, “and he’s very consistent.”Few reserve big men in the NBA have been as consistent as Theis has been throughout January. He has been everything the Celtics could have hoped for, and then some.
MINNEAPOLIS – The Boston Celtics are now 0-for-2 in their attempts to slow down Karl-Anthony Towns.  As a result, they’re now 1-1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves.Towns, the top overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft, was unstoppable during Minnesota’s 124-122 win over Boston Monday night at the Target Center. He finished the contest with game highs of 28 points and 13 rebounds for his 32nd double-double of the season.“Towns had his way with us the whole night,” said Brad Stevens.And it started at the jump.Minnesota’s big man, who totaled 25 points and 16 rebounds against Boston back on Dec. 21, came out of the gates red-hot, notching 15 points and seven rebounds during the first quarter alone.  He shot 7-of-10 during the period, including a 4-of-6 performance from inside the paint.Such efficiency was the story of the night for the Timberwolves as a whole, not only for Towns.  Minnesota scored 48 points in the paint, where Evan Turner said the Wolves “made a living,” thanks to dominant play in the post from its bigs and dribble penetration from its perimeter players.“They manhandled us in the paint,” explained Isaiah Thomas.Stevens added, “I just thought that we physically got handled, especially by Towns.”Minnesota’s dominant performance at the offensive end pushed it ahead by as many as 16 points on the night.  It led by at least 10 points during each of the four quarters and nursed a double-digit lead for most of the second half.Monday’s contest marks three consecutive games during which the Celtics struggled against bigger, taller frontlines.  Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert combined for 34 points and 25 rebounds Friday night in Salt Lake City., and Nikola Jokic and Danilo Gallinari combined for 40 points and 16 rebounds Sunday night in Denver.  During this contest, Towns and Gorgui Dieng combined for 45 points and 25 boards.“You have to figure out what you can do to make it as difficult as possible (against bigger frontlines),” said Stevens.  “That’s life in the NBA for everybody but four or five players really.  That’s just the way it is and you’ve got to figure it out and be as solid as you can be and make it as difficult as you can.”Boston did turn the tables on Towns and Minnesota’s offense late in the game.  Stevens flipped his defense into a zone, which forced consecutive turnovers after the change.  The C’s then began trapping Towns when he caught the ball on the block, which essentially took him out of the game during crunch time.Such defensive strategies provided the Celtics with some life down the stretch.  They trailed by 14 points with 3:58 left on the clock but knew that all hope was not lost.“I just felt like we were still going to have a chance at the end,” Jae Crowder remembered thinking as he looked at the scoreboard at that moment.  “It was just up to us to capitalize on it.”The C’s did so by scoring 22 of the game’s final 32 points.  They trailed by 10 points with 1:22 remaining yet whittled that deficit down to one when Avery Bradley canned a 3-pointer from the right wing with 6.2 seconds left on the clock.“You can never count us out,” said Isaiah Thomas, who managed to score 18 points despite struggling all night to catch a rhythm at the offensive end.  “We’re always going to give it our all and keep fighting and we did.”He ended his final comment of the night by saying, “We gave ourselves a chance to win, but just came up short.”Following Bradley’s 3, Zach LaVine made only one of his two free throws, providing the Celtics with a chance to tie or win the game with 5.3 seconds remaining.  However, Marcus Smart took the inbound pass three quarters of the court and fired up a 3-pointer that bounced off of the front of the rim as the final buzzer sounded.Boston did have a chance to win, and after the game its players were proud of that fact.  Yet they knew that the final play of the night was not the deciding factor in their most recent defeat.As Turner put it, “There were a lot of things that occurred prior to that.”Yes, a lot of things, such as buckets and boards in the paint.  Towns, the NBA’s most talented rookie, was the lynchpin of it all. 

BOSTON – The Celtics weren’t too friendly with the painted area through the first six games of their series against Milwaukee. Saturday night during Game 7, however, they became best friends, and that relationship propelled the Celtics into the second round.The Celtics controlled Game 7 from the opening tip thanks to their domination of the lane. They led for more than 44 of the 48 minutes of the contest while scoring 60 points in the paint.That total was logged after Boston scored no more than 42 points in the paint during any of their previous four games of the series. Its 60 points in the paint matched the largest total accumulated by either team during the series.“I just think that we simplified what we wanted to do offensively a little bit,” said Al Horford, who scored 11 of his 13 field goals from inside the paint.“We were more specific running a certain amount of sets,” he said as he continued his explanation. “We weren’t all over the place. We ran specific sets and just made it simple for the guys to make simple reads.”Boston sure made it look simple as it picked Milwaukee’s defense apart with an inside-out attack.Pounding the paint was clearly a point of emphasis from the jump, as the first 12 points Boston scored from the field were all tallied from inside the paint. From dinger-rolls, to layups, to alley-oops, the Celtics were doing it all.And while their previous box scores may not indicate it, the C’s claim that this style of play had been brewing in their system for quite some time.“We’ve been attacking the paint and looking to kick out a lot,” said Terry Rozier, who tallied 26 points and nine assists. “The past three or four games we’ve been emphasizing that.”That emphasis came to a head once Game 6 arrived. Boston scored only 36 points in the paint during that contest, but as the team reviewed the film afterward, it found something.“We felt like we saw some more openings open up in Game 6,” Stevens said of the interior.Once Game 7 arrived, they took advantage of those scoring pockets.Boston’s players rolled hard and cut to the rim with purpose throughout the night, and when taking the ball off the dribble, the did so with poise and power. Such play produced 47 shot attempts from inside the paint, which accounted for 56 percent of the team’s overall shots. Most of those shots fell in, as the C’s converted upon impressive 63.8 percent on their attempts inside the lane.What made things even more difficult for the Bucks defense was that after Boston established its presence inside the paint, it then began to capitalize on the open looks it found on the perimeter. The C’s made eight 3s during the second half alone after Milwaukee’s defense began to collapse to the lane.“We balanced kicking out with scoring at the rim much better today,” Stevens commented. “It’s probably the best we did all series, which is a good thing.”It sure is, because it was the key to unlocking a victory during Game 7 at TD Garden. The Celtics played with force while attacking the basket early and often. The Bucks had no answers for Boston’s interior attack, and by the end of the night, they had no answers for Boston’s perimeter play, either.It took six games for the Celtics to produce a game tape that outlined their recipe for offensive success. They watched and learned from it just in time.Boston realized it needed to get friendly with the paint. It finally did so Saturday night to spur a season-saving – and series-clinching – victory.
BOSTON – Much of the talk after Boston’s Game 1 victory over the 76ers will revolve around how the Celtics limited Philadelphia to 5-for-26 shooting from long range. What may be more important, however, were the 3-pointers that Philadelphia never attempted.Limiting Philadelphia’s clean 3-point attempts, and in particular those by sharpshooters J.J. Redick and Marco Belinelli, was just as important to Boston’s game plan as containing Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. The C’s simply couldn’t afford to let those shooters get going and open up the court for the Sixers’ well-known stars.“It was pretty high on the list,” said Shane Larkin, who served as one spoke of a four-defender wheel that chased Redick and Belinelli around. “You never want a shooter to get going, especially a shooter like [Redick], top-five in the league. So really, you’ve got to focus in on that, make it of high importance.”It didn’t take long for the Sixers to realize that one of Boston’s top goals was to protect the 3-point line.Philadelphia entered the game having averaged 31.4 3-point attempts per game during the postseason. Redick and Belinelli combined to average 13.4 attempts per game.During the first half of Game 1, the duo managed to attempt only five combined 3-pointers, making two. By the end of the night, they had shot just 3-for-9 from long range – 1.4 fewer makes and 4.4 fewer attempts than their postseason average.The key to Boston containing the Sixers sharpshooters was its aggressiveness in jumping screens. The quartet of Larkin, Terry Rozier, Marcus Smart and Jayson Tatum doubled as Redick’s and Belinelli’s shadows throughout the contest. Philadelphia’s shooters couldn’t escape them.Larkin explained after the game what his group’s mindset was as it attempted to chase Redick and Belinelli around.“Just staying attached,” he said. “Those guys are always moving, they’re always active, they’re always cutting. You’ve just kind’ve got to stay attached to them, try to play physical and try to blow up those screens and just try to make it hard for them to get open looks.”Larkin and Smart, in particular, showcased an elite ability to jump screens and render those picks as useless. Their body position was consistently perfect.It was not a surprise that Larkin and Smart, or Rozier for that matter, remained in the air space of Philadelphia’s shooters. It was a surprise, however, that Tatum was able to do so.This was a unique assignment for the 6-foot-8 rookie. Larkin, Smart, Rozier and Jaylen Brown typically make up Boston’s foursome that is tasked with chasing opposing guards around the court. But with Brown missing Game 1 due to a strained right hamstring, Tatum oftentimes shifted over a position defensively Monday night.Tatum stepped up to the challenge, chased Redick and Belinelli around, and finished the game with the best defensive rating of any player who logged more than 22 minutes of action.“It’s very unique,” Tatum said of his defensive assignment Monday night, “especially with their guards. Belinelli, Redick, they’re constantly moving. You can’t relax for half a second, because they’ll get a look. It was tough.”But Tatum and the crew made it look easy, all thanks to their effort and their attention to detail.The Celtics not only limited Philadelphia’s efficiency from long range, they also limited Philadelphia’s ability to even utilize the 3-point line.Just how they drew it up during their single off day before tip-off.

BOSTON – Brad Stevens was reluctant to reveal his starting lineup to the media Thursday evening ahead of Game 5 of the Eastern Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. It turns out, something was up his sleeve.After dropping Games 3 and 4 in Cleveland, the Celtics coach decided it was time for change. So, he swapped Aron Baynes into the starting rotation for Marcus Morris, and it made all the difference in the world.Baynes’ addition allowed Boston to start off the game with a big presence in the front court, which was critical after losing consecutive rebounding battles by double-digits. With Baynes clogging the lane and battling Cleveland’s bigs on the boards, the Celtics defense was able to thrive. As a result, Boston won both the rebounding battle and the defensive fight, all while handing the Cavaliers a convincing, 96-83 defeat, and grabbing a 3-2 series advantage. From the start, Baynes was matched up against Cleveland center Tristan Thompson, a physical body-banger who has historically given Boston issues on the glass with the most recent being a 12-rebound, Game 4 effort.In Game 5, however, Thompson ran into all of Australia, and he couldn’t find his way around. He was limited to series lows of 1 point and six rebounds over 26 minutes, while Baynes countered with six points, seven rebounds and a team-high three blocked shots over 29 minutes.Cavs coach Ty Lue believes that matchup advantage was critical to Boston’s 32-19 start, which helped set the tone for an eventual win. “I think considering what happened in Games 3 and 4 when Tristan was great on the glass and finishing around the basket, to start Baynes with a bigger body, going bigger with him and [Al] Horford was pretty good,” said Lue. “And Morris came off the bench and had a good game (13 points, six rebounds), so it was the right move.” Stevens explained he made the move partly for that matchup advantage and party because it would allow for smoother transitions with his rotations throughout the game.“The purpose for that change was we're going to have to play big some. We wanted to play big a little bit more,” said Stevens. “But, it was more to get two wings off the bench so that we could then rotate our wings with basically quick breaks around the timeouts if we could, because we knew we were going to play those guys (Morris and Marcus Smart) a lot of minutes tonight.”The reason why Baynes was not starting earlier in the series was because Cleveland initially started small. During Game 1, the Cavs started George Hill, J.R. Smith, Kyle Korver, LeBron James and Kevin Love, so Boston’s best bet was to match them with a small ball lineup, having Morris at the 4 and Horford at the 5.It didn’t work out so well for Cleveland, as it was blown out by 25 points in Game 1. That prompted Lue to swap Thompson in for Korver, placing the former at the 5 while sliding Love and James down to the 4 and 3 positions, respectively.The Cavs played much better following that move, but the C’s continued with their small lineup until Game 5 when they countered back by going big as well.The lineup alteration went smoothly for Boston, probably because Baynes already had 76 regular season and postseason starts under his belt during the 2017-18 campaign.“I think for our team in general, it's the lineup that we were going with most of the year, or for a good part of the year,” said Horford, who finished with 15 points and 12 rebounds. “I felt like it was great for us defensively. They made adjustments after Game 1. We kind of stuck around with the same lineup. But I think that just by doing that, it was a change that worked in our favor.”Largely thanks to that change, the Celtics are now just one win away from a trip to the NBA Finals. First, however, they must return to Cleveland for Game 6. Which begs the question: Will the Cavs make a counter-adjustment with their season hanging in the balance? The C’s will have to just wait until Friday night, right before tip-off, to find out.
DENVER – It happens. It’s as simple as that.Sometimes in the NBA, you just run into a buzz saw, and that’s what happened Monday night when the Celtics ran into Jamal Murray.Murray constructed a masterful performance that sent Boston to an 0-2 start on its five-game road trip. The third-year guard sliced, diced and chopped the Celtics up in every which way as he tallied a career-best 48 points during a 115-107 Denver win. That total marks the fifth-most scored by any player in the league this season.Boston had no answers for Murray, but it wasn’t for lack of effort. As Brad Stevens explained after the game, the C’s basically threw the kitchen sink at Murray to no avail.“We tried a lot of different guys, a lot of different coverages, we tried to go small and switch, tried to do a lot of different things,” Stevens said, “and he pretty much cooked us all night. He had a heck of a game.”You can say that again.Murray got hot early and his hand never cooled off. He scored 14 points during the first quarter, nine during the second quarter, six during the third quarter, and 19 during the fourth quarter.Following the impressive performance, the Celtics felt regret for letting Murray become comfortable in the first place.“I thought he got a couple of easy ones that made him feel good right out of the gate,” commented Stevens. “He had been struggling shooting the 3 coming into this game, at least versus his level, and we left him early and he had that 10-point run in the first half when we were really scoring the ball. And from that point on he was just lights-out.”That happens in this league. The NBA is a collection of the best basketball talent in the entire world. So many players are capable of going off, and that’s why the league has already had 11 performances of 40 or more points already during the first three weeks of the season.Tonight, the hot hand just happened to be strapped to the arm of Murray.“It’s the NBA,” Jaylen Brown said calmly after Murray’s performance. “When somebody catches fire, it’s hard to put that fire out.”Boston now heads to Phoenix with an 0-2 record in tow on this season-long, five-game road trip. As frustrating as that record may be, it’s not as if the Celtics have played poor basketball on this trip. They’ve just run into two of the hottest teams in the league thus far in the season that were a few points better on two particular nights.In Indiana, they took on a Pacers team that had won four out of five heading into their matchup. The two teams went toe-to-toe until the final seconds, when Victor Oladipo connected on a back-breaking and game-winning 3-pointer with 3.4 seconds left.Monday night in Denver, Boston met a Nuggets team that had racked up the second-best record in the league heading into tip-off, at 8-1. Then one of their up-and-coming stars, Murray, turned into an unstoppable force.These things happen.Teams hit game-winners. Players catch fire and can’t be put out.This is the NBA.
PHOENIX – Phoenix never saw a Sun set like it did Thursday night.The locals wished they hadn’t. The visitors, meanwhile, savored every second.Boston incinerated Phoenix’s 22-point, second-half lead in what felt like minutes and put the Suns down for good after yet another clutch 3-pointer from Marcus Morris. Morris tied the game at 100-100 with 1.1 seconds left in regulation, and the Celtics dominated overtime en route to a shocking 116-109 victory.The dramatic, comeback win was Boston’s second such victory of the season and evoked memories of last season’s never-say-die team. That squad could never be counted out, and it appears that trait has carried over to this year’s group as well.“It’s good to know that we’ve got some of that stuff we looked like at times last year in that locker room,” a proud Brad Stevens said after the win. “We saw it on full display in the fourth quarter and overtime.”The Celtics trailed by 17 points with less than seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter before Kyrie Irving put the team on his back. Irving scored 10 points in less than two and a half minutes to make it a one-possession game with 35 seconds left. Then came the final play of regulation, when he cut hard with the ball to draw two defenders, and then found Morris for the game-tying 3-pointer from the top of the arc.While Irving deserves credit for giving the Celtics a fighting chance, the underlying story beneath this late comeback was the type of play that fueled it. That fourth quarter, capped by the late Irving-Morris connection, was emblematic of Boston’s blueprint to success: trust, confidence, execution.“That’s who we are: the second-half team that showed up,” Irving said after the game. “Not so much worried about the shots going in but finding the right shot, the right player at the right time, and just trusting that each of us, we’re going to be selfless.”“It’s just easy when you’re selfless,” he said. “When you see two bodies in front of you, or a decision needs to be made or that extra swing pass needs to be made, just flow into it. Don’t even think about it. When you get to that point, then you know that the trust is there and we can continue to grow from that point.”Irving gave the team an example of selflessness and trust, while Morris gave it an example of confidence and execution. Stevens drew up a two-man play for the tie that involved Irving and Morris. Morris needed to execute a hand-off and screen for Irving, and then he needed to read the defense correctly, all before drilling the shot. He nailed every step of the play before nailing the loudest blow into Phoenix’s coffin.Morris explained to Celtics.com how he prepared himself to execute at such a high level while exiting his team’s huddle.“Coming out of the timeout, I just try to envision myself hitting that shot,” he said. “I’ve been blessed to knock down my few, and it’s all come from my teammates doing a great job of finding me.”In this particular instance, Irving was the one who found him, and his ensuing shot sent the Suns fading into darkness.Most of Thursday wasn’t pretty by any stretch of the imagination, but when that Sun finally set, boy, was it magnificent.These Celtics are proving that they can never be counted out. When they play the right way, with trust, with confidence, and with execution, they can accomplish anything.Anything, including erasing a 17-point deficit in a matter of minutes to put the Suns down in Phoenix in improbable fashion.
SALT LAKE CITY – If you keep playing with fire, you’re gonna get burned.The Boston Celtics learned that lesson the hard way Friday night in Salt Lake City while falling 123-115 to the Jazz.For the second time in as many nights, Boston fell behind by 20 points during the second half. For the second time in as many nights, it staged a comeback. This time, however, it came up short.After overcoming a 22-point deficit Thursday night to down the Suns in Phoenix, the Celtics clawed back from 20 points down to pull within four on five separate occasions during the final eight minutes of Friday’s matchup with the Jazz. That’s as close as they got, as Utah answered with a bucket each and every time.Certainly, the fact that the C’s were able to fight back into two straight games stands as a positive. It does not, however, overshadow the fact that the team has built sizable deficits in the first place.This time around, Boston allowed the Jazz to catch fire early and to maintain a hot stroke well into the second half. The Jazz shot 60.5 percent from the field during the first half and then rattled off a 12-2 run early in the third quarter to open up an 18-point lead.“You know, those runs, you can’t let (happen) in the NBA,” Brad Stevens said after the game. He referenced three spurts from Utah before adding, “Just can’t have those. Put you in too big of a hole.”It’s not often in this league that a team can crawl out of 20-point holes, so the Celtics need to avoid them moving forward. A key to doing so will be slowing down the opponent’s top scoring threats.During Boston’s last three games, at least one top scoring threat from the opposing team has notched at least 27 points. Jamal Murray scored 48 for Denver, Devin Booker scored 38 for Phoenix, and Joe Ingles scored 27 for Utah. That isn’t sitting well with the C’s.“We’re letting guys that we know are going to do certain things do those things,” he said after the game, according to Jay King of The Athletic. “That’s a slap across Brad’s face and this coaching staff who spends countless hours, countless days, preparing us and giving us the tools we need to go out there and to cut that off.”That trend has Stevens wondering what’s going to happen Sunday evening in Portland, when the Celtics will take on the 9-3 Trail Blazers.“Obviously with (Damian) Lillard and (C.J.) McCollum next,” he said, “they’re probably licking their chops on us right now.”Really, it’s the Celtics who should be licking their chops to get back onto the court and fix what has dogged them of late.Their defense simply hasn’t been good enough. They have allowed opposing teams to build huge leads that are nearly always insurmountable. They have allowed opposing scorers to score in bulk. That doesn’t cut it against quality opponents.“It’s tough to beat a good team if you pay 36 minutes of good basketball,” Stevens said.It’s time for the Celtics to play 48 minutes of quality basketball and see where that takes them. It’s time for them to throw some water on that fire and step away.
BOSTON –The best offense is a great defense. That’s a phrase that the hottest team in the NBA swears by.Over the past two and a half weeks, the Boston Celtics have torched opposing defenses to the tune of a league-high 125.4 points per game. They’ve won all eight of their matchups during that stretch, most recently downing the Atlanta Hawks Friday night at TD Garden, 129-108. And they’ve done it all while continuing to hang their hats on the opposite side of the court.“Our identity is on the defensive end,” Kyrie Irving insisted following a 24-point, five-rebound, five-assist, four-steal effort against the Hawks. “We have the ability to switch 1 through 5 at times, and we try to keep the teams out of the paint and make them take tough shots down the stretch. We extend our defense up at the top of the key so teams are running their offense with 15, 14 (seconds) on the clock, so we just try to pressure them and then use that to our advantage and create opportunities for the offense.”The Celtics’ defense created plenty of opportunities for its offense Friday night via the turnover, forcing Atlanta to cough the ball up 24 times over the course of the matchup. That led to a whopping 44 points off of turnovers for the Celtics, marking the highest single-game total of the season league-wide. Being on the opposing end of that feat was frustrating for first-year head coach Lloyd Pierce, but having helped out on the Philadelphia 76ers’ sidelines over the past five seasons, he also understood that those types of efforts are to be expected out of the C’s.“There’s a reason they’ve been No. 1 for the past couple of years,” Pierce said of Boston’s defense. “They really crowd the paint, they’ve got versatile defenders, athletic defenders, and they do a good job of staying five guys on a string.”The Celtics weren’t consistently staying attached to that string during the first quarter of the season, as they dealt with some communication and effort issues early on. Those have been corrected, however, largely thanks to Marcus Smart.The fifth-year guard was inserted into Boston’s starting rotation right at the start of its winning streak, and the team has leaned on his tenacity and leadership ever since.  “He’s able to guard multiple positions,” said Irving, “he’s very communicative on the defensive end, making sure we’re in the right spots, and I think that for him – most guys are pretty even keeled, but for him – when he’s all the way to his maximum, everyone follows suit.”When Smart’s teammates see him diving on a loose ball or taking a charge, that makes them want to do the same. It gets them all on the same page and allows them to play on a string.Defenses that play on a string tend to force turnovers, and turnovers often lead to easy transition buckets. The Celtics have had plenty of those during their eight-game winning streak, which has enabled their offense to put up some crazy numbers.“Our offense has picked up, obviously, in the last three weeks or so,” said coach Brad Stevens. “So, we’ve just got to make sure our defense stays at the level it needs to.”Because the best offense is a great defense. 
WALTHAM, Mass - The Boston Celtics took a massive hit to their frontcourt depth Monday in learning that rookie big man Daniel Theis has suffered a season-ending meniscus tear in his left knee. The injury occurred during the final minute of Sunday night's game against Indiana, when Theis' knee buckled while trying to defend Pacers guard Victor Oladipo. Celtics coach Brad Stevens was greatly disappointed to hear the news Monday morning, but he anticipates that Theis will be able to push through the rehabilitation process and eventually come back stronger than ever."I appreciate the way that he approached every day, and he'll approach the rehab the same way," said Stevens. "But you really feel for him. He was a guy that came in knowing he could play, but maybe not even expecting to have the type of season he had. And he didn't change that when we brought Greg (Monroe) in and mixed up minutes here and there. He just kept being who he is, and we're going to miss him on the court. But he'll have a full recovery and he'll be able to get back better than ever when he steps back out on the court."Despite the injury, Terry Rozier says that Theis was in good spirits Monday morning when he came into the team's training facility. As locker neighbors, the pair have grown particularly close this season, so Rozier is going to miss Theis' company on and off the court."He's fine. He's not down," said Rozier, relaying the interaction he had with Theis. "That's just the type of guy he is. I felt like I've known him for a long time and he's just a great guy. We hang out on the road a lot, so it's just tough to see it. All we can hope for is a speedy recovery."With Theis' season now over, the Celtics are trying to figure out how to best to fill his void. Fortunately, the C's have some depth in their front court, but they'll also have to get a bit creative in order to make up for Theis' defensive versatility against small-ball lineups."One of the reasons we wanted to sign Greg was because you never know what can happen with your depth inside," said Stevens. "But then there have been times where we've played smaller with Theis at the 5, and he's been able to switch and do some of those types of things. So, you might see Semi (Ojeleye) out there a little bit, kind of á la the Summer League stints where he guarded more of the skilled 5s and was able to move his feet on switches and really use his athleticism."Guerschon Yabusele will also be joining the C's following a stint with the Maine Red Claws, and Stevens added that the rookie big man "will fill a role."The C's will have more roles to fill than just Theis' for the foreseeable future, as they are battling a number of injuries to key players. Kyrie Irving could miss some time with left knee soreness, Jaylen Brown is sidelined with a concussion, Al Horford is home sick, Marcus Smart is undergoing tests for a thumb injury, and Shane Larkin is still facing a minutes restriction because of soreness in his right knee. And, of course, Gordon Hayward remains out indefinitely as he rehabs his left tibia/ankle.Because of the plethora of injuries the Celtics are dealing with, the team was forced to have a very light practice Monday afternoon. Stevens took the opportunity to bring all of the young players together and deliver a message that would lift their spirits during the time of hardship."Through all the things that are going on, he was just making sure that everybody still believes in each other and that the team can still have success," Rozier said, relaying Stevens' message to the media. "Brad's great at that - at making everybody feel special and making everybody feel as one."Stevens wanted his players to believe in themselves, because he wholeheartedly believes in them."We are equipped, and we will battle on," said the coach.The battle will continue Wednesday night, when the C's host the Washington Wizards at TD Garden.
BOSTON – Over the last few weeks, the Boston Celtics have begun to prepare themselves for what they hope will be a banner-winning season. All the while, they have been drawing inspiration from another local team that is within striking distance of capturing a title of its own.Coach Brad Stevens has been highlighting moments from the Boston Red Sox’ historic, 108-win campaign throughout Celtics training camp, with the hope of inspiriting his players before the start of the NBA season.Most recently, Stevens brought up the unselfishness of Red Sox utilityman Brock Holt. Last week, Holt became the first player in MLB history to hit for the cycle during a postseason game, doing so in Game 3 of the American League Division Series against the rival New York Yankees. Yet the next day, Holt was benched in favor of Ian Kinsler.Despite his career performance the night before, Holt was completely on board with the decision, knowing that Kinsler had a strong history against New York’s Game 4 starter, CC Sabathia.Having Holt’s type of unselfish mindset is something that Stevens hopes to see out of his own players this season, knowing that they will all have to make sacrifices in order to reach their ultimate goal.“We’ve used [the Red Sox] as examples quite a bit,” Stevens said Sunday afternoon ahead of Celtics practice. "The Brock Holt example last week of going for the cycle and getting a DNP the next day, is how you win, right? And being willing to take on those roles – both as the guy that did it and the guy that replaced him the next night in Kinsler – those things matter. They’ve set a great example for us as we move into a new year.”Stevens knows that many of the examples he shares with his players can go without saying, because there is such strong mutual support among the players on all of Boston’s teams.   “We talked about [the Holt example] a little bit in film, but everybody knows it,” said Stevens. “Everybody’s paying attention to what’s going on. And all of us, whether we’re transplanted or not, become fans of the teams here.”It didn’t take long at all for Stevens to become a fan of the Red Sox. He and his family were fortunate enough to move to Boston just a few months before the Sox hoisted the 2013 World Series trophy.“Ever since then I’d say our whole family has been hooked,” said Stevens. “And it’s just a blast to be able to go over there and watch them work.”Stevens had the opportunity to watch the Sox work in person Saturday night, as he attended Game 1 of the American League Championship Series against the Houston Astros. Although the Red Sox wound up losing 7-2, Stevens still had a blast going out to support them, just as he does with all of Boston’s teams."I get such a kick out of being a fan and just enjoying that,” said Stevens. “Obviously, it didn’t turn out the way we wanted, but hopefully they’ll get [Game 2 Sunday night]. I think that it’s just special to get a chance to [support] all these teams. Certainly, the Red Sox have had a historic year. They've always rebounded when something tough has happened.” Whether it’s an ability to overcome adversity, or an act of unselfishness, the Red Sox are constantly showing qualities of being a championship-contending team. All the while, their acts are providing great examples for their neighbors over on Causeway Street, who are hoping to contend for a title of their own this coming NBA season.
PHOENIX – Patience is known to be a virtue. Let’s have some with these Boston Celtics.Boston’s 6-4 start to this season has elicited groans from many observers. The media is overreacting, some fans are clamoring for change, and even the players and the coaches have been grumbling about their performance.There’s no getting around the fact that we all know the Celtics are better than this. They haven’t played to their potential on a consistent basis this season.But give it time. It will happen. This season is only three weeks old.As Kevin Garnett used to tell Celtics fans, “Rome wasn’t built in a day.”Or, as Aaron Rodgers once told Packers fans, “Five letters here just for everybody out there in Packer-Land: R-E-L-A-X.”You get the point – or at least you should. This is going to take a little bit of time, and it’s going to take a whole lot of effort.Talent, of which Boston has plenty, doesn’t always eliminate the existence or potential of struggles. In fact, oftentimes in the NBA, it creates them. There are plenty of examples in recent history.The 2010-11 Heat team, with LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, got out to a 9-8 start to the season. They made it to the Finals.The 2014-15 Cavaliers team, with James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, got out to a 5-7 start to the season. They made it to the Finals.The 2017-18 Thunder team, with Russell Westbrook, Paul George and Carmelo Anthony, got out to an 8-12 start to the season. They wound up going 40-22 over their final 62 games and earned the fourth seed in the loaded Western Conference.The Celtics are similarly loaded to those teams, and they’re currently experiencing similar growing pains.Things don’t snap into place when two of a team’s best players return from significant injuries, nor do they hum perfectly when four key players are adjusting to significantly different roles.Kyrie Irving went five months without playing live basketball, and Gordon Hayward went 10 months without playing live basketball. Both players are still working their bodies and their games back to where they were prior to their injuries. It doesn’t happen overnight.Irving, a five-time All-Star, struggled out of the gates. He didn’t look like himself while averaging just 14.0 points per game during his first six contests. Obviously, his struggles impacted the team during that period. He has finally returned to his All-Star form during the last four games, however, and averaged 27.0 PPG during that span.Hayward, meanwhile, is facing a far more steeper climb from the devastating left-ankle injury he suffered last season. No one could realistically expect him to return to pre-injury Hayward at this stage of the season. That’s likely going to take months, at the very least. He needs time to work out the kinks and rediscover his game.Again, patience.While those two players are working their way back to their former selves, Aron Baynes, Jaylen Brown, Terry Rozier and Jayson Tatum are all adjusting to new roles compared to those they played in last postseason. During Boston’s run to the Conference Finals, all four were starters, and Brown, Rozier and Tatum were looked to as primary scorers. With the returns of Irving and Hayward, Baynes and Rozier have shifted back to the bench, and Tatum and Brown are getting fewer touches and attempts than they did last postseason.These are very different roles, and new roles with new teammates require adjustment periods. The Celtics clearly are still in the midst of theirs.The long and the short of Boston’s story thus far is that it’s as talented as any team in the league, but it will take time for it to reach its full potential. That’s nothing new for a loaded team in the NBA.Irving and Hayward need time to work themselves back. Baynes, Brown, Rozier and Tatum need time to adjust to their new roles, as well as the new lineups that accompany those roles.Frustrations and questions are inevitable, but pull it back a bit. All is not as gloomy as it may seem.The Celtics are 6-4 and could easily be 8-2, all while dealing with the aforementioned obstacles and a schedule that Brad Stevens called “a bear.” They’ll figure it out in the end.In the meantime, do yourself a favor and heed the words of a famous old adage. Patience is a virtue, so have some.
BOSTON – Fifteen days ago, the Boston Celtics suffered what was perhaps their most eye-opening loss of the season – a 117-109 defeat at the hands of the visiting New York Knicks, who were only 4-14 at the time. It marked Boston’s seventh defeat over a 10-game stretch and its ninth overall, as the team fell to 9-9 on the season.But it also seemed to have marked a turning point for the C’s, who have since won four of their last five games, including three straight leading into Thursday night’s rematch against the Knicks at TD Garden.“Our identity is definitely forming a lot better than when we were playing against the Knicks that day,” C’s point guard Kyrie Irving stated following practice Thursday afternoon. “Just in terms of our energy, our focus, our lineup as well, and just going out there and competing and having fun doing so.”Through the first month of the season, that energy and that focus wasn’t there 100 percent of the time. Boston's inconsistency led to frustrating losses, like the one to New York on Thanksgiving eve, and those types of losses didn't sit well with the team.The last two weeks, however, have contained some of Boston’s most complete efforts of the season. Its offense has been clicking, its defense has been playing on a string, and as a result, its collective attitude has shifted in a more positive direction."Everybody's not hanging their heads," said Marcus Smart, who has recently joined Irving in the starting backcourt. "It's a little bit more daylight in the locker room, and it's good to see everybody smiling.” It’s understandable as to why the Celtics may have been hanging their heads during their November rough patch, especially considering all of the talent they had on paper.“Everybody was just trying to find a way to come up with wins and (figure out) why we were losing,” said Smart. “Nobody could find a solution, so we were all just upset – not at each other, but just with the situation we were all handed.”It seems now that the C’s have discovered the solution to their early struggles: to all be willing to sacrifice and play to their respective roles for the betterment of the team. “I think that we all wanted to win individually, but I think we wanted to win on our own terms,” suggested Irving. “And when you have that, when you have your own individual intent, I think that that could get in the way of what’s best for the group. So, I think we’re getting past that point now.”Some teams take longer than others to iron out their early-season kinks. Last season’s version of the C’s, for example, quickly found its footing after Gordon Hayward’s season-ending injury on Opening Night, as it flew out of the gates to a 16-2 start. This season’s team, on the other hand, has taken a bit longer to start forming an identity. “It’s taken some time,” said veteran big man Al Horford, “but now we’re starting to understand that we need to play at a certain level. I just think that we’re all understanding what our roles are, and it’s making everything easier.”With that being said, the Celtics also have to remain grounded. One thing they learned through the first quarter of the season is that they can’t take any opponent for granted. They’ll keep that in mind Thursday night during their rematch against the Knicks, who are now 8-17.“We realize the challenge is tough,” head coach Brad Stevens said looking ahead to the matchup. “I mean, the last time New York came here, they pounded us, every which way and so we’re going to have to play better.”This Celtics team, however, is different than the one that was pounded by the Knicks back on Nov. 21. In just 15 days, this group has grown into a more cohesive, positive unit, and they’ll look to continue to show that Thursday night.  
ORLANDO – One key factor stands above the rest in the reason behind Orlando’s 1-0 record against the Celtics this season. According to Brad Stevens, that factor is frontline play.The Celtics and the Magic are set to meet again at 7 p.m. tonight in Orlando, nearly 12 weeks after the Magic knocked the C’s off 93-90 on Oct. 22 inside TD Garden. Orlando’s starting frontcourt was dominant during that game, outscoring Boston’s 55-33 and outrebounding Boston’s 27-20.Stevens certainly hasn’t forgotten.“Their frontcourt had 55 between the 3, 4 and 5 (positions) out of their 93 (total points),” he said Saturday morning, after being asked what stood out to him about the Magic. “And so we came up short in some areas when you look back at the defense where we need to be better.”In particular, the Celtics must be better against Nikola Vucevic, who is making a serious bid for his first career All-Star selection with season averages of 20.2 points, 12.0 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game.Vucevic was the game’s leading scorer and rebounder during the first matchup between these two teams, as he tallied 24 points and 12 boards. Eight of his 11 made field goals that night were scored inside the paint, where he averages 11.0 PPG this season.The challenge of defending Vucevic around the paint tonight will be compounded by the fact that Aron Baynes remains sidelined with a left hand injury.Baynes is widely considered to be Boston’s top interior defender and rim protector. The Celtics have greatly missed his presence of late while facing off against some of the league’s elite interior players, as exemplified by the quintet of DeAndre Jordan, Karl-Anthony Towns, LaMarcus Aldridge, Marc Gasol and Clint Capela combining to average 22.2 points and 13 rebounds against Boston during Baynes’ absence.Coincidentally, Baynes also missed the first matchup between these two teams when Vucevic played so well.Without Baynes, Al Horford will likely see the lion’s share of defensive possessions against Vucevic. Daniel Theis and Robert Williams are almost certain to see time against Orlando’s top scorer as well.Williams, in particular, may have earned a greater opportunity tonight after his performance Thursday night in Miami. The big man checked in for the first time during the third quarter of that game and helped Boston trim a 26-point deficit all the way down to eight during that period. After the game, Stevens lauded Williams’ ability to affect shots in the paint with the presence of his bouncy and lanky body.Tonight will be a whole different animal than Thursday night, however. There is no big man on Miami’s roster who compares to the offensive package which Vucevic brings to the table. The Celtics are well aware of that fact after watching Vucevic and his frontline teammates lead the Magic to a win up in Boston earlier this season.
NEW YORK – Tonight’s matchup between the Celtics and the Nets will look very different – on both sides of the ball – than it did one week ago.This time around, Brooklyn is healthy, and Boston is not.The opposite was the case one week ago, on Jan. 7 at TD Garden, when a fully-loaded Celtics squad cruised to a 116-95 win over the injury-riddled Nets. Boston led by as many as 24 points during that contest, and none of its starters were needed for more than 28 minutes of service.That result was not surprising considering that the Nets were missing two key players that night in Joe Harris and DeMarre Carroll, who rank third and fifth on the team in scoring, respectively. Both of those players will be available for tonight’s game.Harris enters the contest averaging 13.4 points per game and is shooting at a blistering 48.3 percent clip from downtown on the season. That percentage has been maintained while Harris is attempting an average of 5.0 shots from 3-point range per game, which is quite an impressive feat.Carroll, meanwhile, carries averages of 10.6 points and 4.8 rebounds per game into the matchup. What may make an even greater impact tonight, however, is his defense.Carroll has built a reputation as a versatile defender who can handle multiple positions on the court. That ability plays right into one of Brooklyn’s strengths, according to Brad Stevens.“I think they have a lot of versatility defensively,” Stevens said at Monday morning’s shootaround. “I think that they’re superbly coached, and they all know what they do, and they do it every single night.”Meanwhile, on Boston’s side of the ball, the C’s are likely to be missing a key cog to their defensive versatility tonight. Marcus Smart did not attend shootaround after he woke up Monday morning feeling ill. Stevens said that he doubts Smart will be able to recover in time for tonight’s game.Additionally, the Celtics will be missing their All-Star point guard during tonight’s contest. Kyrie Irving will miss his fifth game of the season after he suffered a right quad contusion Saturday night. Irving said that he suffered the injury, which caused a knot to build up in his leg, after he came down awkwardly on a continuation play in Orlando. Irving said the injury “could have been bad,” and added that he will be ready to go Wednesday night against Toronto.However, his absence, combined with that of Smart, leaves two holes in Boston’s starting lineup tonight. Irving is Boston’s leading scorer and assist man, and the team has yet to play game this season without their star perimeter defender, Smart. Their absences will require multiple Celtics to step up and deliver strong performances against the Nets.Terry Rozier is almost certain to step into the starting lineup in place of Irving. Rozier has played some of his best ball of the season when he has stepped into Irving’s starting shoes. In four games as a starter, the fourth-year point guard has averaged 14.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2.0 steals per game.The player who will step into the other open slot in the starting lineup isn’t quite as automatic. Stevens has multiple options, including Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Semi Ojeleye. Brown was chosen as the starter the last time Boston was missing two starters, as Stevens seemed to want to keep Hayward in his role as a playmaker off the bench.No matter who steps into the starting lineup in Smart’s place, and whoever bumps up in the rotation as a result of Smart’s and Irving’s absences, Stevens expects them to rise to the occasion.“One of the things I think about our team is that guys that are getting new opportunity or more opportunity will be ready,” the coach stated. “That’s one of the benefits of having a group like this. You always want everybody available, but our other guys will be ready.”We’ll find out at 7:30 p.m. tonight if that comment is accurate, while these two teams exchange roles on the health front compared to their meeting a week ago.
DENVER – It’s no secret that the young trio of Gary Harris, Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, who are all 24 years old or younger, has fueled Denver’s surprising 8-1 start to the season. However, according to the Celtics, another member of the Nuggets deserves credit for Denver’s rapid rise.Multiple Celtics believe that Paul Millsap has played an integral role in the development of Harris, Jokic and Murray. Two members of Boston’s team, Al Horford and Gordon Hayward, have first-hand knowledge of how important Millsap’s presence can be to a team, and especially to a team’s young players.Horford and Millsap were teammates in Atlanta for three seasons, one of which included 60 wins. Hayward, meanwhile, spent his first three seasons in the league as a teammate of Millsap. Horford spoke Monday morning about how he came to appreciate the way Millsap went about his business, and how Millsap’s work ethic and leadership are affecting the young Nuggets in a big way.“I think that people probably don’t talk about him enough and the impact that he makes in that locker room and what he does for that group,” Horford said ahead of Millsap before Boston’s shootaround in Denver. “I think that’s the difference. This year they’re doing great, and yeah, their guys have improved, but Paul is healthy here, and he’s a reason why they’ve gotten off to a good start.”Millsap was not healthy a season ago, as he was limited to only 38 games during his first campaign with the Nuggets. As a result, Denver’s young players missed out on watching the 13-year veteran prepare throughout an 82-game season. Now Millsap’s teammates have an opportunity to see and learn from his work ethic each and every day.Such leadership cannot be overstated. Every team that aspires for success, especially one as young as the Nuggets, who are the third-youngest team in the league by average age, needs quality veteran leaders.Millsap is exactly that for Denver, just as Horford has been for Boston for the last two-plus seasons. That type of leadership pushes players in the right direction, as both Marcus Smart and Horford explained Monday morning. “Coming in and not really knowing what to expect, and not knowing how things really work, for those vets to come in and really put us under their wings and show us the ropes, it really helped a lot,” Smart said as he looked back to his first few seasons in the league. “You need vets like that. You need guys that come in and are good culture guys and locker room guys and care about the development of the team and not just themselves.”Smart said that Brandon Bass, Gerald Wallace, Jameer Nelson and Rajon Rondo played significant roles in mentoring him and teaching him how to go about his day-to-day work. Horford, meanwhile, mentioned the likes of Mike Bibby, Joe Johnson and Zaza Pachulia in that regard. He went on to explain how those players impacted him while he was a young player.“I think it was just the way that they carried themselves, and then the attention to detail in the game,” said Horford. “I think that the sooner that you pick that up as a young player, the better off you’ll be, because you can have all the skill and talent in the world and that can get you by, but if you’re able to pick up those subtleties and those little things, I think that will make you a very special player.”Therein lies the difference for the Denver Nuggets in the eyes of multiple Celtics. Harris, Jokic and Murray have picked those subtleties up from Millsap, and now they’ve turned the Nuggets into one of the most feared teams in the NBA. It’s no coincidence.So while most of the attention regarding Denver’s impressive start to the season revolves around its talented trio, don’t overlook that wily veteran named Millsap. Horford and the Celtics know what type of impact he has made on the Nuggets. They just want to bring it to a stop for one night tonight when these two powers meet at the Pepsi Center.
PHOENIX – Someone stirred the pot, but it wasn’t Terry Rozier.Rumors began swirling Wednesday that Rozier is unhappy with his reserve role with the Boston Celtics. But as quickly as those rumprs began to swirl, they were just as swiftly blown away by both Rozier and the C’s.“I woke up to the news just like y’all woke up to the news,” Rozier authentically stated at Thursday morning’s shootaround, ahead of Boston’s matchup with the Phoenix Suns. “I don’t know where it came from. I’m happy to be in this position I’m at, playing on a team that’s mentioned to have a chance to be in the championship. So I’m not worried about what’s being said.”Danny Ainge also squashed the rumors while speaking Thursday morning on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s Toucher and Rich show.“I talk to Terry quite a bit, and I haven’t heard any of those things,” Ainge said on the show. “So I don’t know how reliable those things, those sources or rumors, are. Terry hasn’t shared any of those things with me and I think he would if he were feeling that way.”Ainge also mentioned that the Celtics and Rozier and his camp pre-emptively spoke this summer about the role Rozier would have on the team with the return of All-Star Kyrie Irving. Rozier is averaging 22.7 minutes per game this season, after averaging 36.6 per game last postseason while playing in Irving’s place and helping to lead Boston to the doorstep of the NBA Finals.Rozier was and is well aware of his role on this team. He understands that he is a reserve. That may not be his preferred role, but that doesn’t mean he’s grumbling about it or seeking to play elsewhere.“I go from starting in the Playoffs and then to coming off the bench. I’m pretty sure it’s not easy for nobody,” he stated. “And I’m not complaining, and if you know me, I’ve never been the one to complain about (playing time). I would never go to the media or bring out the ‘unhappy’ thing. I would never do that.”He continued, “People that know me know I wouldn’t do that. I’ve never been a selfish type of person, type of player. You can tell the way I play; I’m all about team, ‘we,’ and everything. Everything will be all right. It’s not as bad as people make it sound.”Brad Stevens made similar comments Thursday morning regarding Rozier’s attitude.“Terry’s been nothing but a great teammate here, and nothing but a great guy here,” said the coach. “He’s never said a word to me.”Stevens also spoke about Rozier’s limited playing time. He said that as many as nine players on Boston’s roster are going to feel frustrations throughout this season with regard to the time they spend on the court, simply because the team is so loaded with talent. Stevens sees that as a good thing, rather than a bad thing, and in particular with Rozier.“You wouldn’t expect anyone that’s as ambitious or as accomplished as him to feel any differently than that,” Stevens said.The internal discussion regarding Rozier is focused far more on his actual play than it is his playing time. The point guard said that Stevens approached him after Tuesday’s practice to talk about how he can become more effective in his reserve role.“He came up to me and (said), ‘It’s not good to press and play,’” Rozier revealed. “I can’t press myself and play.“I felt like I was doing that a little bit … If I’m pressing, then it’ll be tough to play, so it made sense,” he said. “Free mind, and everything is going good.”Stevens later gave more insight on the conversation.“Sometimes when you’re playing less, you figure the best way to [make an impact] is to be ultra-aggressive right out of the gate instead of letting the game and the easy play come to you,” said Stevens. “That’s something that’s hard to adjust to, and I think anybody would be struggling to adjust to. So not surprised at all that that’s part of it. And (it’s) also one of the reasons why not I’m not gonna stop playing him the way he’s playing. He’ll get through this and he’ll be great because of who he is.”That right there is the key to this storyline. Rozier, Stevens, Ainge and the Celtics know that Rozier’s character is top-notch. He has never and will never make a peep about his playing time.He’s more concerned with figuring out how to impact games in his new role and help this Celtics team compete for a championship.
BOSTON – The Toronto Raptors, in the midst of their first losing skid of the season, will visit TD Garden Friday night, looking to get back on track against their Atlantic Division rival Boston Celtics.Toronto hit a road bump following its league-best 12-1 start, dropping its last two games at home, including a frustrating, 106-104 loss to Pistons at the buzzer Wednesday night after leading by as many as 19 points.“We’ve made a lot of mistakes,” starting forward Pascal Siakam said before Friday morning’s shootaround at TD Garden. “Obviously, last game we had a big lead and let them come back in the game, and in the end of the game we had a lot of miscommunications and stuff like that. So, we’ve just gotta tighten up a little bit and just play as a team like we always do.”Specifically, the Raptors say they need to tighten up their defense after being outscored 29-16 during the fourth quarter Wednesday night. “Defense should always be the No. 1 priority for us,” said veteran big man Serge Ibaka, “because some nights you may not make shots. Defense is going to help you win some of those close games. So, last night was last night, but we’ve got to learn from that and move on to tonight.”The Raptors, in recent times, have done an excellent job of moving on from tough losses. They haven’t had a losing streak longer than two games since the 2016-17 season, and that’s thanks to their collective mental ability to get back up after being struck down.“We have to understand, OK, we lost two games at home, so this is like a wake-up call,” said Ibaka. “Sometimes you can have a wake-up call in the morning and you say, ‘No, I want to stay in bed for five more minutes.’ Or you say, ‘You know what, I’m going to get up and go to work.’ So, I feel like we have that mentality, like when we lose two games in a row like that, we have the mentality to wake up and do better.” The Celtics recently woke up from a losing skid of their own, rebounding from a 1-4 road trip with a 111-82 win over the Chicago Bulls Wednesday night. They will look to carry that momentum into Friday night’s matchup against the Raptors, with the hope of making a statement on national television.Game 1 of the season series didn’t fall in Boston’s favor, as it dropped a 113-101 contest at Scotiabank Arena. However, that game was only the second of the campaign for the C’s, so they had not yet begun to discover a sense of identity. “Early in the season when we played them in Toronto, it wasn’t who we are now or who we’re trying to grow into,” Kyrie Irving said leading into Friday’s game. “I think that it will be a great test for us. They have a lot of great players as we all well know, so we’re up for the challenge.”As will be the Raptors, who aim to avoid their first three-game losing spell in two seasons when they hit the TD Garden court Friday night.

BOSTON – Brad Stevens gazed intently across the Celtics’ locker room Thursday evening, his eyes locked on a flat-screen TV that was broadcasting the NBA Draft.Boston’s head coach, sitting among roughly two dozen of his equally-eager colleagues, watched as NBA commissioner Adam Silver strode toward a podium stationed 215 miles away at the Draft’s host site in Brooklyn. In his hand, Silver held a card. It contained the name of the No. 3 overall pick – the first, and most substantial, selection that the Celtics would be making Thursday night.The commissioner stepped up to the podium’s microphone, glanced out at the Barclays Center audience, compiled of draft hopefuls, fans and media members, and announced, “With the third pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, the Boston Celtics select… Jayson Tatum, from Duke University.”Back inside the core of TD Garden, Stevens rose from his seat and slowly walked toward the TV as ESPN began displaying Tatum’s college highlights, all of which the coach had surely seen countless times before. Stevens eventually stopped less than four feet from the enormous screen – close enough so that one could watch the reflection of Tatum’s reel in the whites of his eyes  – and smiled in admiration at his newest pupil.For several moments, Stevens did not say a word. He had completely cut himself off from the buzzing conversations that were taking place behind him as he stood grinning with his lips slightly ajar, occasionally nodding with approval. Finally, Stevens blinked out of his trance as the reel faded out.“OK,” he stated to no one in particular. “Here we go.”Stevens, along with president of basketball operations Danny Ainge and the rest of the Celtics basketball ops staff, have become enamored by Tatum’s craft over the last several months. Clearly, observing the abilities of the talented wing has yet to get old.“He’s a really skilled player, a really talented scorer,” Stevens later told the media. “He’s a great kid, has great work ethic. We’re excited to have him aboard.”Later in the Draft, the Celtics welcomed aboard Southern Methodist forward Semi Ojeleye (37th overall), Arizona guard Kadeem Allen (53rd overall) and Cal-Berkeley guard Jabari Bird (56th overall).Tatum, at No. 3, of course was the premier haul of the draft for Boston. The 6-foot-8, 205-pound St. Louis native was the star of the Duke men’s basketball this past winter and spring. During his lone collegiate season, he averaged 16.8 points, 7.3 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.1 blocks per game, all while leading the Blue Devils to a No. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament.Prior to his college days, Tatum was regarded as one of the top high school players in the nation. He earned Gatorade National Player of the Year honors during his senior season at Chaminade College Prep in Creve Coeur, Missouri after averaging 29.6 PPG and 9.1 RPG, all while guiding his team to a Class 5A state title.The previous three GNPOY winners – Ben Simmons, Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins – all ended up being selected No. 1 overall in their respective NBA Draft classes. Tatum likely would have continued that trend had it not been for a blockbuster trade that occurred three days ahead of the Draft.The Celtics originally owned the No. 1 overall pick (acquired from Brooklyn in 2013), but they were confident that Tatum would be available at No. 3, so they decided to trade down. On Monday, Boston dealt the No. 1 pick to Philadelphia in exchange for the No. 3 pick. The C’s will also receive either the Lakers’ 2018 first-round pick (if it falls between 2 and 5) or the Kings’ 2019 first-round pick, both of which Philadelphia had previously acquired via trades.“We would have picked [Tatum] with the first pick,” Ainge confirmed shortly after midnight, while the Draft was near the tail end of the second round. “We like his size and length, his rebounding, his shooting, his intelligence, his character. There’s a lot to like about Jayson. He’s going to be a terrific player.”Above all, Tatum is incredibly versatile. That quality is what excites Stevens more than any other. “A couple years ago, I talked about how we were thin on guys that could play a number of different positions, when you talk about 2-3-4,” said Stevens. “Now we’ve got a lot of position-less players that can dribble, pass, and shoot.”Moments after being drafted, Tatum expressed how anxious he is to join the rest of Boston’s versatile core, which is fresh off of a trip to the Eastern Conference Finals.“I’m extremely excited to be joining such a great, tremendous franchise like the Celtics,” Tatum said in an interview with CSNNE. “They’re a great team, they were the No. 1 seed in the East last year, and I just think with so many great veterans and great players like Isaiah Thomas and Al Horford, [Jae] Crowder, [Avery] Bradley, there’s so much I can learn from those guys.”At just 19 years old, Tatum still has a lot of growth ahead of him. That being said, he has prodigious potential and very well could be a major link in Boston’s pursuit of Banner 18.Perhaps that’s what Stevens was envisioning as he stood by the flat-screen TV Thursday night, watching Tatum’s awe-inspiring highlight reel.Now, all that’s left to do is wait and see how it all plays out. In the words of Stevens, “Here we go.”
BOSTON – Aron Baynes made an outstanding impression on the Boston Celtics and its fanbase during his first season with the organization, providing grittiness, veteran leadership, and a selfless, team-first attitude each day he showed up to work.For those contributions, the Australian big man was rewarded by the team Friday with a brand-new contract.In celebration of the signing, we’re taking a look back at some of Baynes’ best performances from his inaugural season in green and white. Here are his top five.The Celtics typically relied on Baynes to produce in a defensive capacity this season, but when the time called for it, he could also deliver on the offensive end. A prime example of that occurred Nov. 8 when a shorthanded version of the C’s took on the Los Angeles Lakers at TD Garden.Al Horford had been ruled out ahead of the game due to a concussion and Jayson Tatum was lost nine minutes into action with an ankle injury, so the Celtics needed an extra source of offensive energy to make up for those absences.Baynes took on the responsibility by producing a career-high-tying 21 points on 8-of-12 shooting to help vault Boston past the Lakers, 107-96. Baynes’ game-high point total was accompanied by eight rebounds and three assists over the course of 23 minutes of play.The early-season outpour was an offensive coming out party for Baynes, who proved to Celtics Nation that he could be far more than just a defensive force if the opportunity called for it.There’s always added joy in performing well against one’s former team, especially when it involves outplaying an old teammate and friend.Baynes had the pleasure of accomplishing both feats during his first trip back to Detroit on Dec. 10, when he contained All-Star center Andre Drummond to a dismal offensive performance, while helping to lead Boston’s defense to one of its greatest efforts of the season.Drummond had a history of tearing up Boston’s defense, boasting an average of 17.8 points per game against the C’s in 19 career games – his highest scoring mark against any opponent. The first matchup of the season on Nov. 27 didn’t buck the trend, as he tallied 26 points to go along with 22 rebounds, six assists and four steals. That game, however, only featured 13 minutes of Baynes off the bench.This time around, the Celtics opted to start Baynes and gave him more than twice as many minutes to work with. The result? Just six points for Drummond on a season-low 1-of-5 effort from the field and a 91-81 win for the C’s.Baynes scored six points of his own on 3-of-6 shooting and also pulled down a then-season-high 13 rebounds. His defense was suffocating, as he honed in on Drummond to shut off the lob play that was so effective during the previous meeting.The friendly history between two former teammates, as well as the homecoming environment, made the result all the more sweeter for Baynes.Baynes was responsible for doing most of the dirty work in the paint for the Celtics this season, and that often involved protecting the rim and banging bodies against elite post players.On Feb. 28, Baynes was assigned to cover the greatest rebounder of this generation in Dwight Howard, and per usual the Celtics big man delivered.Baynes helped to limit the six-time rebounding champion to three total boards, including just one on the defensive end, en route to a 134-106 beatdown of the Charlotte Hornets. It marked just the second time in Howard’s career that he was held to three or fewer rebounds while playing at least 25 minutes.Baynes, meanwhile, corralled a game-high 10 rebounds and contributed to the offensive explosion with 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting during 22 minutes of play.Baynes spent hours and hours behind closed doors this season working to add a 3-point shot to his game. Finally, during Game 76 of the regular season, his diligence paid off.Boston’s starting center opened up the March 31 matchup against the Toronto Raptors by knocking down five jump shots – each at least 14 feet from the basket – during the first quarter alone. Two of those makes came from long distance, where he had previously shot just 1-of-19 over the course of his career.The 2-for-2 effort from beyond the arc helped kick-start Baynes’ sharpshooting confidence at the most important time of the season. He took his new-found skill into the Playoffs where he shot 11-of-23 from deep for a team-leading clip of 47.8 percent.Now, Baynes is considered to be a legitimate 3-point threat, all thanks to the confidence he discovered beyond the arc toward the tail-end of the season.The Celtics entered their regular season finale against Brooklyn having already locked up the second seed in the Playoffs. But that didn’t make it a meaningless game – at least not to Baynes.With five of his core teammates resting up that night, Baynes took it upon himself to lead the young group of Celtics that took the court, and he stepped up to deliver the best performance of his career.Baynes erupted for a career-high 26 points on 12-of-23 shooting, all while corralling a season-high 14 rebounds to help guide Boston to a 110-97 win. He did all of that during just 20 minutes of play, becoming the first NBA player in more than 50 years to log at least 25 points and 14 rebounds while playing 20 minutes or fewer. He also became the first Celtics center to tally at least 25 points and 14 boards in a game since Kevin Garnett on Dec. 3, 2008.Baynes’ gritty, under-the-radar style of play rarely landed him in the spotlight during the previous 81 games, but it was the perfect way for the hard-working big man to cap off his season.“He’s done whatever we’ve needed to win, every single game this year,” C’s coach Brad Stevens said after the game. “He’s just a pro’s pro. He shows up every night. He shows up to play. He’s appreciative of the opportunity to play in the NBA, and to do this for a living, and he’s had a great impact on our team.” 

BOSTON – Gerald Green – quite fittingly – is back in green.The Boston Celtics announced Wednesday night that they have signed Green to a free-agent contract.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Boston chose Green with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft and the swingman spent his first two NBA seasons with the club.  He was then dealt to Minnesota on July 31, 2007 as part of the package that landed Kevin Garnett in Boston.Green is entering his 10th season in the league.  He owns career averages of 10.0 points and 2.5 rebounds per game and has shot 36.1 percent from long range.Last season, as a member of the Miami Heat, Green posted averages of 8.9 points and 2.4 rebounds per game.  Prior to his one-year run with Miami, Green had averaged double-figures in the scoring column during three of his previous four campaigns, including a career-high average of 15.8 PPG during 2013-14 with the Phoenix Suns.Green fits right into head coach Brad Stevens’ mantra of positionless basketball.  As a long, 6-foot-7 shooter with extreme athleticism, he can and will spend time at multiple positions.Under Stevens’ system, Green is a fit at the “swing” and “wing” positions.  He will help by scoring off the bounce, by spreading the floor, and by rising off the floor for above-the-rim finishes.Although Green is not regarded as a high-level defender, he is serviceable at that end and is likely to improve under the guidance of Stevens and his coaching staff.It will be a full-circle story if Green is able to make an impact on next season’s Celtics team.  He was drafted by Danny Ainge 11 years ago, but his career has been a rollercoaster ever since.Green, now 30 years old, entered the league as a 19-year-old super-athlete.  He showed glimpses of stardom during his first two seasons with the C’s, including winning the 2007 Slam Dunk contest, and that’s why Minnesota wanted him included in Boston’s package for Garnett.However, after a short stay with the Timberwolves that included only 29 games played, he was traded to the Rockets and then waived shortly thereafter, on March 8, 2008.  Green signed with Dallas during the offseason, played 39 games with the Mavs, and then was out of the league – for nearly three full years.For those who had seen Green’s highlight dunks and flashes of star potential, it was shocking to know that the then-23-year-old, with loads of ability, was unable to find a job in the NBA.  That, however, was the bitter truth.Green was forced to play two seasons overseas, in Russia (for two teams) and China, and one in the D-League, before finally getting another shot at the NBA in February of 2012.  But even then, his future was in doubt.The New Jersey Nets went out on a limb and signed Green to a 10-day contract – the type of contract that is most typically given to D-Leaguers as stopgaps for teams – on Feb. 27, 2012.  Green showed enough promise, commitment and growth to garner a second 10-day contract.Shortly thereafter, he began to make an impact in New Jersey.  He scored 26 points in 23 minutes on March 10, 2012, during just his seventh game with the Nets.  Four days later, he scored 26 points yet again.  Green went on to score at least 15 points during 11 of his 31 games with New Jersey.Green’s stretch with the Nets showed those around the league that he was ready to contribute full-time at the NBA level.  He went on to sign a three-year, $10 million deal with Indiana during the 2012 offseason.Green played well off of the bench for Indiana during 2012-13, scoring 7.0 PPG in 18 MPG, and was traded to Phoenix the following summer.  The swingman went on to average 15.8 PPG and 11.9 PPG, respectively, during his two seasons with the Suns.Now, after a one-year stop in Miami, Green is back where it all started more than 11 years ago.His impact was quite minimal during his first stop in Boston, but a lot has changed since then.  Green has matured, both as a person and as a player, and has proven that he can be a key rotational player.Now he has a chance to make an impact on the highly-regarded Celtics during his second stint in green.
BOSTON – Five months after suffering a season-ending meniscus injury, Daniel Theis is nearly back to playing full-scale basketball.And the process of getting to this point has taught him an unexpected new skill.Theis, who tore his left meniscus during a March 11 matchup with the Indiana Pacers at TD Garden, has been inching his way back into basketball activities during recent weeks. He says that he has made rapid improvements during the early parts of August.“Since I’ve been back (from Germany) – it’s almost two weeks now – I’ve been getting step-by-step progress and doing more,” he told Celtics.com during an exclusive interview at Boston’s new practice facility. “I’ve been doing jump shots, sprints, cutting, change of direction, jumping, so more basketball-like. Over the summer it was more preparing the knee, doing a lot of exercise, lifting.”Theis said his most recent progress has finally brought the light at the end of his rehabilitation tunnel into vision.“I’m just happy because now I see the goal to being back on the court and playing 5-on-5,” he said. “Now it’s just day-by-day, and I progress every day and get new stuff to do. From Monday, I was just running ‘S-curves.’ Today, I was hard-cutting and sprinting.”The big man, who averaged 12.7 points, 10.5 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per 36 minutes during his rookie season, said that he’s “going to be 100 percent” for the start of training camp, which arrives Sept. 25, but there is no set date for his return to live action.There were high levels of enthusiasm and excitement in Theis’ voice as he spoke about approaching the finish line of his rehabilitation. To the contrary, those levels were at ground level just a few months ago as he struggled through the low points of the first in-season injury of his basketball career.Theis was injured just as Boston was beginning to make its final push toward the Playoffs, and an eventual push toward a berth into the NBA Finals. He was planning to be a key part of all of that, and then, in an instant, he wasn’t. That dart from one end of the spectrum to the other took a significant toll on his psyche.“I never missed a single game of the season,” he said, speaking of his career. “So this time, we as a team and I worked so hard to get to the Playoffs, and then in mid-March when I got hurt, it hurt not just my knee, it hurt me. I can’t be on the court anymore and fight with the team.”As he coped with that realization, he also came face-to-face with another harsh reality: that this rehabilitation would be dreadfully monotonous and lengthy.“At the beginning, when I got hurt, I tried to come back as quick as I can, and the docs and trainers just told me that I need to be patient and I need to take my time and it needs time to heal,” he recalled. “You can’t rush this process.”Due to the timing of the injury, that process would go on to engulf his entire offseason.“Normally it’s like you take one, two, maybe three weeks off and get away from basketball and get away from sports a little bit,” Theis said of a standard offseason. “This summer was just working out basically every day. I had one or two days off, but I knew I needed to work out just to be back, and so my knee was prepared and ready when I came back here (to Boston) to process the new stuff.”As he nears the completion of his rehab, and with all but five weeks of the offseason in the rearview mirror, Theis now looks back on the process and realizes that it taught him a valuable life-lesson.“I’ve never been a patient guy,” he said with a laugh. “If I hear something, I want to do it right away. It’s been five months, and that changed. I learned how to be patient and go step-by-step, day-by-day.“Over the course of the injury and over the summer, I also got more patient at home, and more calm, and I just learned how to do this.”At this point, there isn’t much of ‘this’ left for Theis to endure. He’s inching closer to full basketball activity, and soon enough, he’ll return to live action.When he does, he’ll be able to take solace in the fact that he’s added a newfound skill during his lengthy recovery process. He has added patience to his repertoire – though he hopes to never need to call on it again when it comes to injuries.
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics are set to tip off the 2018-19 Season with two rookies on their roster. First-round draft pick Robert Williams will be fighting his way for some frontcourt action, while international journeyman Brad Wanamaker will be looking to break out in the backcourt.We've dug up five fun facts on the pair of first-year Celts, so brush up on your team trivia below as they prepare to make their respective marks in the NBA.Wanamaker was signed by the Celtics this summer after spending his previous seven seasons playing overseas and in the NBA G League (formerly the D-League). Here are his five facts:The Celtics selected Williams out of Texas A&M University with the No. 27 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. Here are his five facts:
ANDOVER, Mass. – Aron Baynes had the opportunity this summer to explore NBA free agency and possibly seek out an expanded role. However, there was no doubt in his mind that he wanted to return to Boston for another season with the Celtics.The 6-foot-10 Aussie center has fallen in love with every aspect of Boston over the past year, from its culture to its competitive sports environment. The latter is what enticed Baynes to join the Celtics last summer, and his appetite for winning is why he was set on sticking around for another go.“I wanted to come to a contender,” Baynes said Tuesday afternoon during an Arbella Home Court Makeover unveiling in Andover, Massachusetts. “I always knew that Boston was going to be able to contend and it was definitely a big part of my decision coming here and trying to fit into the system, trying to help as much as I could.”Baynes ended up having a larger role than anyone expected last season due to a number of significant injuries to his teammates. He started 67 regular season games and averaged 6.0 points and 5.4 rebounds per game over 18.3 minutes per contest. The 31-year-old big man also owned the best defensive rating in the league (97.0) among players who played at least half of the season.Baynes’ role will likely decline somewhat this season now that everyone is back and healthy, but he’s completely content with any responsibility the Celtics put on his plate. He may have a smaller serving of playing time in Boston than he would have elsewhere, but he knows that the organization cherishes the unique contributions he brings to the team.“It’s one of those things where I enjoy and want to be in a place where they want me as well,” said Baynes, who spent the entire summer in Boston. “And that’s definitely something that I’ve felt from the front office and everyone involved.”Baynes has especially felt the love from Brad Stevens and the Celtics coaching staff. The faith that Stevens had in Baynes from Day 1 last season helped build the big man’s confidence, which allowed him to expand his game as both a shooter and a defender.Baynes says that suiting up for a coach who trusts him and utilizes his strengths was also a major factor in his decision to return.“It’s great playing for a guy like Brad,” said Baynes. “He really puts the onus on us to become better shooters of the game … You've seen the development of the young guys and also the more veteran guys are still learning. He’s such a great teacher.”Stevens had a lot of teaching to do last season with 11 new faces on the roster, but this season should be more about fine-tuning. There was hardly any roster turnover this summer, so the continuity should be in Boston’s favor.“Last year at this time we were learning peoples’ names; this year we can get into the finer points of the systems that we’re learning,” said Baynes. “We’ve still got a bit to learn and a way to go in incorporating the healthy guys back into it, but it’s definitely exciting that we’re starting at this base level compared to where we were last season.”Even with last season's injuries and lack of familiarity, the Celtics were still able to advance all the way to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Being so close to making it to the championship round, with still much room for team improvement, left Baynes yearning for more. “It’s always nice to be able to come back and be with a team where you’ve left something that you feel is unfinished,” said Baynes. “There is an opportunity to do a lot. It could be a special one, so that’s what we’re working toward right now.”

NEW YORK – The most talented amateur basketball players in the world will have their dreams come true Thursday night when they’re selected in the 2014 NBA Draft.  If many of them have it their way, their name will be called by the Boston Celtics.As a requirement for accepting an invite to sit in the Green Room at Thursday’s Draft, 20 of the top prospects met with the media Wednesday afternoon to discuss their expectations for tomorrow night.  At least a quarter of those players singled out the Celtics in one way or another during their media availability.One of those players is Noah Vonleh, who grew up in nearby Haverhill, Mass.  He said that he’s been receiving non-stop text messages from friends and family about the prospect of landing with the C’s.“Everybody’s texting me,” he said with a smile, clearly enamored by the possibility of playing for his hometown team.  “They’re like, ‘Bro, I hope you come to Boston,’ and this and that.  ‘It would be crazy!  You’re [playing] for the hometown!  I’ll go to all the games!’”Vonleh is one of several prospects who either grew up in or played high school ball in the New England area.  Those players obviously would love to come back to their old stomping grounds and put together a great career in green and white.  But you don’t need to be a New England product to want to play in Boston.  That much is very clear.Every prospect who worked out for the Celtics saw first-hand that Boston’s tradition is second to none.  Seventeen banners hang above the practice court.  Those things are hard to miss, and they’re quite attractive to players who want to win.“They expect championships,” said Julius Randle.  “They have so many championships in their past and that’s what they expect.”With that in mind, Randle said, “It would be a joy to play for the Celtics.”Randle also singled out Brad Stevens as a reason why he’d love to wind up in Boston.  Stevens has drawn rave reviews from nearly every prospect who has worked out for the team.  Randle and Doug McDermott lauded him yet again on Wednesday.  McDermott recounted the atmosphere of his workout with the Celtics and attributed the good vibes to Stevens.“It was great to have Brad Stevens run the whole workout.  It kind of felt like a college practice, “ said McDermott, who was the consensus National Player of the Year this past season.  “It was definitely probably the most unique [workout], just because that guy has a crazy IQ for the game and he drew up sets for us to run to see how quickly we could adjust to a play call at the end of the game.  I definitely enjoyed that.”It seems that the same can be said for every other prospect who made their way through the Celtics practice facility over the past several weeks.  The Celtics, from Stevens to Danny Ainge to the franchise’s tradition, have been praised by the Draft’s top prospects.  It’s clear to anyone who talks to these guys that they would all love to put a fresh Celtics cap on tomorrow night.

Rodions Kurucs began playing basketball at the age of five with a group of seven-year-olds. Why not with youngsters his own age? Because there was no organized basketball for five-year-olds in Cesis, the Latvian town of fewer than 20,000 people in which he grew up.Why not wait until he was seven? Not an option. Not with his grandfather, Vladimirs Kiselovs, a basketball lifer and venerated coach in Latvia."He had two sons that they finished their careers very fast," said Kurucs. "He wanted us to succeed. So he said, 'you'll be a basketball player.' We didn't have any choice. But we loved it."The "we" includes younger brother Arturs, who also played two years up for his entire childhood, because that was the age difference between he and Rodions.For eight years, the trio was a unit. His grandfather, who came of age in the time of Soviet domination of the region, could be a hard-driving coach."I mean, we had a lot of fights," said Kurucs. "A lot of tears. That was crazy. I still remember all those times now. He was working with me and with my brother. He worked more with me, but my brother always was behind me and trying to do the things I do. I maybe had more talent, but he worked, he had a lot to prove. He proved a lot with his work that he put in the game."Away from the gym they bonded watching games. FC Barcelona was a favorite, mostly because of star guard Juan Carlos Navarro. But their preference was CSKA Moscow, which featured a sharpshooting American whom Kurucs came to idolize, former Duke star Trajan Langdon. Langdon is now Brooklyn's assistant general manager and when Kurucs came to Brooklyn for this year's NBA Draft, he was intent on getting a photo taken with Langdon -- even before the Nets took him with the 40th overall pick.By the time he was 13, it was time for bigger things. On his own, he moved to Latvia's capital, Riga, to play for the youth academy of the city's professional club. He shared an apartment with two others, and learned to take care of himself."Almost every night I was calling my mom to take me back," said Kurucs. "She said if you want I'll come and take you back, there's no problem. But then my grandfather would say to me, 'do you really want to come back or will you push through that and you'll get what you want.' I said, 'all right I will stay here and work'. But still every night, he said to me the same words every night."It was tough. School was tough. In Cesis, everyone knows my grandfather and school was much easier. They give me some bonuses and good grades. When I got there nobody cared about it, who's your grandfather, who I am. I had to study more. I had to take care of myself, food, how to get to the school on the metro and buses. That was tough. I was 13. I had to mature faster."By the time he was 16, he had moved up to Riga's squad in the top division of the country's professional loop, the Latvian Basketball League. Once upon a time, that was at the top of his grandfather's ambition for him. By then, they knew there was more to come. Four years later, he's about to embark on his first NBA season."It's actually a funny story. I just talked with my grandfather about it three days ago I think," said Kurucs. "We never thought that I would go that high actually. I asked him one day when I was younger, 'what do you want? Where do you want me to go? How high?' He said that it would be great if you played in the top Latvian league. I said, 'OK, that's good.' Then after the Latvian team I showed off my skills in a next generation tournament and Barcelona saw me and signed me. He was really happy for that. Who would imagine that I would go that high? Now I'm here, he's like, 'I don't have the words. I didn't even imagine that you could go that high.' I was going for that. That was my dream. That was my passion. I wanted to get here and to work here."NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

BOSTON - He'd already admitted several times that he didn't know if he'd make it through the summer as a Boston Celtic.So it probably didn't hit him until he stepped out to center court. But when he took the microphone at center court to address the crowd, before Friday night's win over the Washington Wizards, it was clear 20 rows from the floor."The only thing I wish is that Red could have been here," Pierce said after the game in his press conference.  "You know, I'm at a place right now in my career; I couldn't ask for anything better.  I'm in my tenth year, I have a great supporting cast.  I want to finish my career a Boston Celtics; this has got to be our run."The meaning of the moment wasn't lost on Pierce's teammates.Pierce thanked the sellout crowd of 18,624 that for sticking with him for "10 long years, through the good times and the bad" and vowed that the team was ready to "turn it around.""We're just trying to keep Paul with the second unit so that they have a go-to guy every time," Coach Doc Rivers said.  "Paul knows that his time."Wizards Coach Eddie Jordan said after the game that he "didn't have the right matchup off the bench for Pierce," and you have to think that if The Truth continues to play similar minutes alongside the reserves, coaches around the league will suffer the consequences, if you will.Pierce went on to finish with 28 points, while KG had a monster game in his official Celtics debut: 22 points and 20 rebounds.  Allen also acquitted himself nicely with a 17-point performance.So when Pierce walked off the floor alongside Garnett and Allen, with a finger pointed skyward with 2:30 remaining and a 98-76 lead, it was official.   The new era is officially underway.Peter Stringer covers the team for Celtics.com.  You can send him .

BOSTON – For seven seasons, the Boston Celtics benefited from having Avery Bradley’s elite on-ball defense on their side. Monday night, they’ll face the nightmarish task of attacking him for the first time.Bradley is set to make his first return to TD Garden after being traded to the Detroit Pistons over the summer. And Celtics coach Brad Stevens has had his hands full trying to prepare for him.“First thing is, obviously you’re very thankful and appreciative for all that he did here,” Stevens said ahead of tip-off. “But then when you start preparing for him, you realize it was a lot more fun when you weren’t preparing for him. He’s one of the best on-the-ball defenders in the league, so anybody that has to play against him knows that they’re going to have to earn everything.”Bradley has played only 18 games in a Pistons’ uniform, but his impact has been monumental. Detroit, at 12-6, has produced the second-best record in the East behind Boston, and Bradley (16.8 points per game) is a big reason why. “He’s exactly what I expected, which is good, because we expected a lot,” said Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy. “He’s a guy who comes to work all the time. He’s serious, he’s unselfish and he plays hard. I mean, there are no negatives on him.”Boston fans know that better than anyone else. They watched Bradley play his heart out for seven seasons, and his work ethic had an immense influence on Celtics culture in and outside the locker room.“He had a great impact on us, and he certainly did a lot in the community,” said Stevens. “I think people will warmly receive him as we all do, because he had a great impact on us. He deserves the applause that he’ll get tonight.”
SALT LAKE CITY – Cleveland never seemed to embrace Jae Crowder. Salt Lake City, on the other hand, has welcomed him with open arms.That’s exactly what Brad Stevens expected when he heard about the trade deal involving Crowder back on Feb. 8.“When Jae got traded here,” Stevens said Wednesday in Salt Lake City, “I thought that this was going to be perfect.”The numbers support Stevens’ claim.Crowder is averaging more points (15.1 to 12.2), rebounds (5.0 to 4.6) and assists (2.1 to 1.6) per 36 minutes in 19 games with Utah than he did during 53 games with Cleveland. His team has been more successful, too, as Utah has won 15 of the 19 games in which he has played for them.Brad Stevens credits Crowder’s seamless implementation, as well as that of fellow former Celtics forward Jonas Jerebko, to coaching. Stevens holds Utah head coach Quin Snyder in high regard.“I think the Jazz are expertly coached,” commented Stevens. “I think all those guys are put in great positions to soar with their strengths. I think Quin is one of the brightest guys around.”In Jerebko’s case, he is also a player of whom Celtics fans have fond memories. He was a very good role player for the C’s during his two-plus seasons with the team. In Utah, under Snyder, he has been even better.Jerebko’s field goal percentage of 44.8 percent is a higher mark than he ever recorded with the Celtics. His 3-point percentage of 39.9 percent is also well ahead of the mark he set during his time with the C’s, which was 37.7 percent on 302 attempts. Jerebko has already set career highs in 3-point makes (55) and attempts (138) this season, all while averaging slightly less playing time per game than he averaged a season ago with Boston.Jerebko has clearly found a comfortable home in Utah throughout this season, and since the trade deadline, Crowder has, too. These two players were key ingredients to Boston’s success the last two seasons, and now they’re playing similar roles for a red-hot Jazz team. “Those guys are winners,” Stevens said.Crowder, Jerebko and the Jazz have been playing outstanding basketball for months now, and they will certainly pose great challenges tonight to Boston. The good news for the Celtics, though, is that they know those two players as well as anyone, so they may know what it will take to slow them down.- Marc D'Amico
BOSTON – Brad Stevens has made a remarkable case for the NBA’s Coach of the Year award this season, but there is one individual who would leave the Celtics’ coach off the voting ballot. That individual? Stevens, himself.Yes, despite all of the obstacles Boston has overcome this season and despite all of the success it has experienced, Stevens still does not believe that he should be ranked among the league’s top coaches.“There are 29 other great coaches, and just to be a head coach in this league is enough,” Stevens explained Saturday evening ahead of tip-off against the Toronto Raptors at TD Garden. “There’s no way that I would ever consider myself to be in that race.”Stevens may be too humble to make a case for himself as Coach of the Year, but ironically, the man who may be his biggest competition for the award stepped up to the plate instead. Shortly after Stevens delivered his modest response, Raptors coach Dwane Casey told members of the media that Stevens should be near, or at, the top of everybody’s list, considering Boston’s ability to constantly triumph over adversity.“Brad, he’s done a heck of a job,” said Casey, whose Raptors currently sit three games ahead of the Celtics for first place in the East. “Losing Gordon Hayward, their free-agent All-Star, and to win 16 in a row after that. And then losing Kyrie Irving, who’s another All-Star, and to see where they are now and the job they’ve done. That’s a heck of a job.”A heck of a job, indeed. While the C’s have dealt with non-stop injuries throughout the season, there has been one constant holding them together: Brad Stevens on the sideline. Without his calming presence and coaching mind, it’s very unlikely that Boston would have a firm hold of second place in the East this late in the season.Stevens may truly believe that he doesn’t belong in the running, but that’s just his humble nature shining through. For those on the outside looking in, however, it’s undeniable that he should be right up near the top of every voter’s Coach of the Year ballot.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – Game 1 of the preseason did not come without its share of bumps and bruises for the Boston Celtics. Al Horford sprained his right wrist Friday night during Boston’s 104-97 loss to the Charlotte Hornets in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and as a result, he will be sidelined for Sunday evening’s rematch in Boston.The good news that Coach Brad Stevens shared Sunday afternoon is that it does not appear to be a serious injury.“Al’s feeling a little bit better as we inch toward game time, but he won’t play,” Stevens told the media inside TD Garden ahead of Game 2. “I would say it’s a wrist sprain – I don’t know exactly the level – but it doesn’t sound like it’s going to cut into any of the early part of the season.”Horford injured the wrist during the first quarter Friday night and it got sorer as the contest went on. He sat out during the second half and has been rehabbing it over the last two days, but Stevens believes he could return to action by Tuesday when the C’s host the Cleveland Cavaliers.Aron Baynes, who started 79 regular season and playoff games for the Celtics last season, will take Horford’s place at the 5-spot to start alongside Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum and Gordon Hayward.Speaking of Hayward, his first game back from last year’s season-ending ankle injury went about as well as anyone could have hoped. The 28-year-old wing tallied 10 points, three rebounds, one assist, one block and zero turnovers over 23 minutes in what was his first live-game action since Oct. 17, 2017. More importantly, Stevens reports that Hayward has “had no issues” with his surgically-repaired ankle during the first week of preseason play. The next step for Hayward, says Stevens, is regaining his basketball habits.“Offensively and defensively he’s still feeling it out again,” said the coach. “He was just figuring it out when we headed to Cleveland for Game 1 last year – it probably took him as much time as anybody. And now he’s had a year he hasn’t played, so it’s going to be a process.”Hayward is more than ready to tackle that process, and he’ll continue his comeback Sunday evening as he plays his first game inside TD Garden since last preseason.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – If there’s one thing about Jaylen Brown that stands out to Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens, it’s the 21-year-old wing’s persistent desire to improve. Having watched him grow over the past two years, Stevens appreciates Brown’s commitment to the game, and he made sure to point it out Tuesday evening ahead of Boston’s preseason matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers at TD Garden.Brown spent the whole summer working on making those improvements, and he’s looking forward to showing the basketball world how much he has grown since the end of last season.“This year, I’m excited to get back,” said Brown, “because I worked really hard on certain aspects of my game – free throws, ball-handling, playmaking for others – so many things that people have critiqued me on in the past. It will be interesting to see if they critique me this year.”If Brown is able to silence the critics, it’s because of the immense work he put into this past offseason. He tested the limits of his body on a daily basis, working under challenging conditions while striving toward his maximum potential.“It’s a mindset about making yourself a little bit more uncomfortable,” explained Brown. “Some things people are better at than others, so you just have to work a little bit harder. I had a realization with that this summer and I worked really hard at some of the things I’m not as good at.”Now, it’s finally time for Brown to show off his improvements, so sit back and enjoy what he has in store for the 2018-19 Celtics season.- Taylor Snow
CLEVELAND – One of the most challenging, imminent tasks that the Boston Celtics coaching staff faces heading into the 2018-19 season is determining how deep their rotation will go. Having a team that is overflowing with talent is not a bad problem to have, but it certainly will not make rotational decisions easy, as some highly-skilled players will be forced into limited roles for the betterment of the team.So, how will the coaches decide which players make the cut?“Whoever adds value to winning at the highest level,” coach Brad Stevens answered Saturday evening ahead of the Celtics’ preseason finale in Cleveland.“There’s inevitably a cutoff,” continued the coach. “If you have a really good team and they’re playing really well, then there’s usually guys that could add value to winning that don’t get the same cracks as others – it’s just part of it, and it’s an unfortunate part of it. But we’re not going to base it on what’s been done; we’re going to base it on what’s going on and happening. So, whoever’s adding value to winning will play, and hopefully we find the right groups.”With all of that being said, Stevens also noted earlier this week that every player on the team will play an important role at some point this season. Injuries may happen, opportunities are bound to arise, and there is enough talent on the Celtics’ roster to fill any void that occurs.At the moment, the team is mostly healthy. Gordon Hayward (back) and Kyrie Irving (ribs) have minor injuries that will sideline them for Saturday night’s game, but they are not expected to miss extended time.Their absences for the preseason finale, however, will give other players opportunities to step up and prove themselves worthy of making it into the rotation. So, that makes this an important final test before the regular season begins.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – Celtics wing Jaylen Brown will not suit up for Friday’s matchup against the Cleveland Cavaliers, as he’ll miss his second straight game due to a lower back injury that he suffered in Dallas last weekend. He is, however, showing strong progress and anticipates that he’ll be able to return to action sooner rather than later.After getting a few shots up ahead of tip-off, Brown made his way back to the locker room and updated reporters on his status, seeming upbeat and optimistic.“I’m better, a lot better than I felt yesterday,” said Brown, who had found a strong offensive rhythm during the games leading up to the injury. “I’m just taking it day by day.”Brown will travel with the team to Minnesota immediately following Friday night’s game and says there’s a slight possibility he could return to the court for Saturday night’s contest against the Timberwolves.“I think it’s a possibility. We’ll see,” Brown said hopefully. “I didn’t test it as much as I’m going to test it tomorrow, so I’ll have a better understanding tomorrow of where I’m at and the pain level. If it’s bearable, I’ll be able to go.”Brown has experienced lower back tightness throughout his career, so he has a routine that he goes through that helps loosen him up. The fall he took against the Mavericks, however, caused it to tighten up and even resulted in back spasms that lasted a few days.“My lower back kind of clinched up, but it’s looser now,” Brown insisted. “I’ve been working on it the past couple of days, so it’s loose now, my lower back feels a lot better and the injury is improving as well. I’m just looking forward to getting back on the court.”- Taylor Snow
MINNEAPOLIS – Who would have thought that the Minnesota Timberwolves would improve after trading away Jimmy Butler?Minnesota was 4-9 on the season when it traded Butler, who was leading the team in scoring with an average of 21.3 points per game. It has gone 7-2 since the trade with Philadelphia, which netter the Timberwolves Robert Covington. Dario Saric, Jerryd Bayless and a second-round pick.The list of teams Minnesota has taken down during its resurgence is not impressive, as only one of the wins came against a team that sits above the .500 mark, but its play certainly has improved. With Covington, who is one of the better wing defenders in the league, in the fold, the Timberwolves have become the league’s second-best defense since the trade. At the other end of the floor, Karl-Anthony Towns and Derrick Rose have been playing incredible basketball.“He’s playing at a ridiculously high level right now,” Brad Stevens said of Towns before tonight’s game. “And they’re really posting him, really going to him in every which way. He’s playing with unbelievable force and confidence.”Towns is averaging 21.6 PPG on 15.3 field goal attempts per game since the trade. Those numbers are up from 19.9 PPG on 14.9 FGA per game prior to the trade.One boost the Celtics will have tonight in their matchup with Towns is a rested Al Horford. Horford was held out of Friday’s blowout win over the Cavaliers for rest purposes, and that rest should set him up with a full tank of gas as he prepares to defend Towns throughout tonight’s game.Thanks to a break in the schedule and last night’s rest, Horford has not played since Monday night in New Orleans.While Boston uses Horford and the remainder of the frontline to slow down Towns, it will also need to dedicate plenty of attention to Derrick Rose, who has suddenly returned to playing at an incredibly high level. Rose is averaging 20.5 PPG since Nov. 5, and 19.9 PPG since the Butler trade.The key to Rose’s resurgence has been the combination of his speed off the dribble with an improved 3-point shot. Rose is shooting 48.6 percent from long range this season, which ranks fourth in the league.“He’s an amazing downhill player who’s shooting 48 percent from 3, which makes it really tough to guard him,” Stevens said of Rose’s return to glory. “It’s just a testament to a lot of hard work and a belief that you just kind of keep going and good things will happen. He’s playing at a high level.”The Timberwolves in general are playing at a high level since they dealt away Butler. Towns and Rose are leading the way, while newcomers Covington and Saric are helping Minnesota to be one of the better defenses in the league.- Marc D'Amico
CHICAGO – The Boston Celtics blew out the Chicago Bulls by 29 points back on Nov. 14, but it’s worth noting that Chicago was without its reigning leading scorer and rebounder during that beatdown. Lauri Markkanen will be present, however, in Saturday night’s rematch at United Center, and his presence alone could make for a much more competitive battle.Markkanen missed the first 23 games of the season with a right elbow injury, and the Bulls struggled during that time going 5-18. The sophomore forward returned to action last week, and already Chicago has looked like a stronger team.Markkanen was reinserted into the starting lineup Tuesday night in Indiana, where he tallied 21 points and 10 rebounds in a six-point loss to the fourth-place Pacers. Last night, he made an even bigger impact against the Oklahoma City Thunder, pouring in 24 points, along with seven rebounds, to help lead Chicago to its first win since Nov. 21.“They looked like they played with great purpose last night, great effort, great togetherness,” C’s coach Brad Stevens said ahead of Saturday night’s tip-off. “They obviously have a lot of talented, young guys and Markkanen makes a big difference. His ability to stretch the floor is a little bit unique even to most 4s because you can be there, but he can still get it off. It’s hard to challenge his shot because he’s so tall.”The 7-footer has already connected on 11 3-pointers during his first three games back, and the Celtics know first-hand just how dangerous he can be beyond the arc. Markkanen shot 53.8 percent from deep last season against the C’s, while averaging 14.7 points per game.While Markkanen should give the Bulls’ front line a boost Saturday night, the Celtics will be severely depeted in that area of the court. Aron Baynes will be sidelined with an ankle injury, Al Horford was a last-minute scratch due to knee soreness, and Robert Williams is out due to personal reasons. This just means that the Celtics will have to buckle down even more, as they look to cool off Markkanen’s hot return.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – On the night before their head-to-head matchup at TD Garden, Celtics coach Brad Stevens and Heat coach Erik Spoelstra both found themselves glued to a television screen – Stevens at his home and Spoelstra in his Boston hotel room. They weren’t reviewing film for the next evening, nor were they observing other NBA games around the league. Instead, they were locked into a different sport, as they watched Tom Brady lead the New England Patriots to yet another miraculous berth into the Super Bowl.As two men who are striving for perennial prosperity in their own sport, Stevens and Spoelstra could both appreciate the unapparelled success that they were witnessing as the Pats earned their ninth trip to the NFL’s biggest game in the past 18 years. “It was amazing,” Stevens said ahead of Monday night’s tip-off. “I think being in this and knowing how hard it is to win a single game, I was telling my son, 'You know, you're living the '60s Celtics, the'60s and '70s UCLA (men’s basketball team).' That's the kind of thing we’re talking about with what the Patriots have accomplished."Spoelstra, who coached his own team to four consecutive NBA Finals appearances from 2011 to 2014, says it was unlike anything he has ever witnessed.“You can’t even write a script for that,” said the veteran coach. “You get into the last two minutes and watch greatness and excellence like that, it seems like you’re watching a rerun to a movie under the highest stakes, pressure, all those things. “I just enjoyed watching the sideline,” he added, “when they showed a picture of [Brady] and it just looked like he was Buddha on the mountaintop in Zen getting ready for his next push. I can’t say I was rooting for them, but you respect it. Man, it’s incredible what he’s doing. It’s up there with what anyone’s accomplished from a team standpoint.”Despite coaching in an another sport, there are still teaching moments that both Stevens and Spoelstra can take away from Sunday night’s AFC Championship and carry into their own locker rooms.“I mean, there's going to be a thousand of them,” Stevens said. “But I think at the end of the day it starts with just their resolve, their dedication to doing every little thing, and their ability to just stay the course with incredible connectivity. It was clear as day that they had a plan of attack, that they all knew the plan of attack, and they stuck with it no matter what happened.”Both Stevens and Spoelstra aim to channel that type of approach on the hardwood Monday night as the Celtics and Heat battle it out at TD Garden.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – A new chapter begins Thursday night in the historic Celtics-Lakers rivalry, as LeBron James comes to Boston for the first time donning purple and gold.While the jersey on James’ back is different, the strategy in going up against the 15-time All-Star remains the same for the Celtics.“With a guy that good, you have to guard him as a team,” C’s coach Brad Stevens said ahead of tip-off. “We have a lot of guys that are very versatile that I think can really work to make it as difficult as possible on a guy like that, but I think ultimately there’s a reason why the best are the best, and you just have to all expend extra effort to guard him as a team.”Boston is familiar with game-planning against James, having seen him 10 times last season, including seven times in the Eastern Conference Finals. They have as good of a tool set as any team in the league when it comes to defending him, though that still doesn’t make the task much easier.“There’s a big reason why the whole league has filled up with as many versatile guys on their rosters as possible, is to be able to guard the LeBron James of the world,” Stevens said. “And that’s still a very difficult challenge.”In his 16th season, James has not yet lost a step in his game. He is averaging 26.9 points, 8.4 rebounds and 7.3 assists per game, while shooting 51.6 percent from the field. However, James has been less durable this season than in years past. He has already missed 18 games because of a groin injury, which is four more contests than he missed during the previous three seasons combined.  James is back in full swing now, though, and he’ll be up to the challenge of playing inside the hostile TD Garden as always, as he opens up this new chapter of the Celtics-Lakers rivalry.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – When Doc Rivers looks at the depth chart for the current Boston Celtics roster, the first thought that runs through his mind is, “Holy goodness.”The former C’s coach and current coach of the LA Clippers sees such promise in Boston’s talented group and believes that the key to their long-term success lies in their collective willingness to make sacrifices for one another.   “The sacrifice is what bonds you together,” Rivers said Saturday evening before facing his former team at TD Garden.“It’s only one ball and only five guys that get to play at a time,” the coach explained. “It’s all about winning, and when that becomes the major focus it works out. When the playoffs start it happens more – I think that’s easier – because it is winning time in the playoffs. I look at them and think they’re in a fine place. They’ll be fine. I don’t see it as an issue.”Rivers is familiar with the importance of sacrifice, having coached one of the most talented teams in Celtics history. He recalls that when Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett joined Paul Pierce and the Celtics in the summer of 2007, every player on the team had to lighten their shot load in order to create a winning system.It’s not easy getting everyone on board, but the rewards for buying in speak for themselves. For that particular group, it resulted in an NBA championship during their very first season together.“You tell them what we (the coaches) believe their roles are, and you have to keep selling it and hope they buy into it,” Rivers explained. “It’s not a perfect process. You’ll have stretches where guys buy into it and stretches in the same year where guys try to do more or play outside their roles. You have to keep trying to put it back in the bottle, but at the end of the day, winning is the goal. Winning comes first and then success.”The current Celtics team struggled to find a consistent winning recipe early in the season, as they started off 10-10. However, they have gradually developed into their roles as the season has gone on. Since that .500 start through the first 20 games, they have owned the third best record in the NBA at 25-10.As Rivers indicated, what matters most is that things are rolling by the time the Playoffs begin. With a group as talented as this Celtics team, there is plenty of reason to believe.- Taylor Snow
PHILADELPHIA – Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown views Tuesday’s matchup against the Boston Celtics as one of his team’s biggest tests of the season. The Sixers reloaded at the trade deadline, adding a high-volume scorer in Tobias Harris to their already-imposing starting five. So, this matchup will provide them with a chance to see what they’re made of against the team that knocked them out of the Playoffs in five games last season, and against the team that Brown still views as perhaps the best team in the Eastern Conference. “It’s all about how you get ready to try to – if we’re able to – come against them in the Playoffs and be better than we were last year,” Brown said ahead of Tuesday’s nationally televised tip-off at Wells Fargo Center. “Whether it’s Boston, or Milwaukee, or Toronto, or anybody like that. Because they (the Celtics) are elite; they are still, in my eyes, maybe the team to beat.”The other two teams that Brown mentioned also restocked their respective rosters ahead of the deadline, while Boston stood pat. Still, Philly’s coach seems to believe that the Celtics have what it takes to go the distance in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.The 76ers have seen the Celtics at their best twice this season: on opening night, when the C’s won by 18 points at TD Garden, and on Christmas Day, when Boston won by seven in overtime, again on its home court.What stands out most to Brown about Boston is its shooting ability on one end of the court, and its tenacity on the other end. “When they win, they turn people over,” Philly’s coach explained. “And when they win they hunt 3s; they really are good at producing 3s. And, if you go back to that game on Christmas Day, we had 19 turnovers – it’s too many. They [took] 41 3s – it’s too many.”“They’re strong,” Brown added in regard to Boston’s defensive toughness. “You’ve gotta go body-body-ball if you’re going to drive.  And if you drive, you better go to dunk. If you want to create a lead, you have to go forearm and fist and show a hand. If it’s limp, it’s going to get stolen.“And then (when we're on defense), are we appropriately helping? We don’t want to get into scramble mode and just run around the gym and let them pick it apart with 3s.”While Brown views this as a game for his team to test themselves against a potential playoff foe, it’s also worth noting that the Celtics will be without their leading scorer in Kyrie Irving, who is out with a strained right knee.“I wish Kyrie was here,” Brown said, acknowledging the notable absence. “But it is a game in February, and it’s another incredible opportunity for us to learn.”- Taylor Snow
BOSTON – All-Star break couldn’t have come at a much better time for the Boston Celtics, who are currently battling through injury and illness. They just have one more obstacle to overcome in facing the Detroit Pistons Wednesday night, before earning some much-needed R&R after grinding through a jam-packed, pre-All-Star slate.“It’s a good time for everybody,” Stevens said of the upcoming break. “The one thing the NBA didn’t do when it adjusted its schedule forward, starting games on Oct. 17, was they didn’t move the All-Star break forward, so you’re playing more games the last two years than have ever been played in a row. And you can see it’s ultimately something people look forward to, but you don’t want to look ahead. We have a game to play tonight against a team playing very well, and if we can leave it on the court, that’s what we hope to do.”Boston will have to leave everything on the court Wednesday night because they will be missing four key bodies against the Pistons. Aron Baynes (foot) and Kyrie Irving (knee) are both sidelined with injuries, while Terry Rozier and Robert Williams are both at home recovering from a stomach bug.The hope is that they can battle through the injuries and enter the break on a high note, while using Tuesday night’s 112-109, shorthanded win in Philadelphia as motivation.“We realize that we’ve played pretty well in the past month and a half, although there have been multiple days where it sure hasn’t felt like it. And we played well last tonight, in response to two that we really don’t feel good about,” said Stevens. “We want to feel good about ourselves heading [into the break]. It doesn’t mean you’re going to win the game, you just gotta play with great effort and you gotta play together. Last night was a real purposeful game. Like, we played the right way the whole game and we just need to back that up.”Do that, and the Celtics will be able to enter their well-deserved break with a positive attitude, which can hopefully set the tone for the final stretch of the regular season.- Taylor Snow
BOSTON (May 20, 2017) – The Boston Celtics today announced that Isaiah Thomas will miss the remainder of this year’s postseason following re-aggravation of a right femoral-acetabular impingement with labral tear during Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Cleveland. Thomas initially injured the hip during the third quarter of the Celtics’ March 15 game against Minnesota, forcing him to miss the next two regular season contests. The injury was further aggravated during Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals at Washington on May 12. “Isaiah has worked tirelessly to manage this injury since it first occurred,” said Celtics Chief Medical Officer Dr. Brian McKeon. “The swelling increased during the first two games against Cleveland, and in order to avoid more significant long-term damage to his hip, we could no longer allow him to continue.” Thomas did not travel with the team to Cleveland and is currently evaluating treatment options. A further update will be provided as soon as one is available.

BOSTON – The Boston Celtics announced today that guard Ray Allen has exercised his option for the 2011-12 season.

BOSTON – This wasn’t even a debate.Isaiah Thomas is officially an NBA All-Star. The NBA announced during tonight’s special on TNT that Thomas will be heading to Toronto.  He's joined by Jimmy Butler, DeMar DeRozan, Paul Millsap, Andre Drummond, Chris Bosh and John Wall as the seven reserves chosen to the Eastern Conference All-Star team.All-Star reserves were chosen by the league’s 30 head coaches.  That’s why it should come as no surprise that Thomas has been named to the team.After all, these are the coaches whom Thomas has mystified all season long.Each and every opposing coach constructs a game plan against the Boston Celtics. Atop those game plans, undoubtedly, stands Thomas’ name, likely in bold letters.Stopping Thomas is each opponent’s top priority, yet rarely has a team succeeded in achieving that goal. Thomas has been a full-time starter since Nov. 4 and has scored 16 or more points during all but four of his 44 games since.  He is averaging a career-high 21.6 points per game this season, which leads all Eastern Conference point guards and ranks seventh among all guards in the NBA.Who accompanies Thomas at the top of that list?  The likes of reigning MVP Stephen Curry, MVP runner-up James Harden, Damian Lillard, Russell Westbrook, DeMar DeRozan and Jimmy Butler.Who’s looking up at Thomas on that list?  Klay Thompson, Kyle Lowry, John Wall, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul, all of whom are All-Stars this season, and four of whom have been chosen as an All-Star starter during their careers.Simply put, Thomas has etched his name into the elite category of scorers in this league.  That is a fact.Another fact is that scoring is no longer the lone weapon in Thomas’ arsenal.  He has grown as a distributor, using his vision and passing ability to create shots for his teammates.Thomas ranks third in the NBA in drives per game, with an average of 11.3 a night.  His ability to get into the paint puts an incredible amount of pressure on defenses.  He draws off-ball defenders in, then finds his teammates for open shots.Those ingredients have led to Thomas dishing out a career-best 6.6 assists per game this season.  He ranks ninth in the league in that category, and second among Eastern Conference guards who have played at least 33 games.Thomas would likely be an All-Star this season solely based upon his impressive statistics and rankings.  Take into account his impact in the win-loss column, and he became a no-brainer.Thomas is the engine that makes the Boston Celtics go.  And as a reminder, those Boston Celtics are only one game back of the third seed in the Eastern Conference.You’d have been called a lunatic had you predicted a year ago that the Celtics would be in this position without signing a major free-agent or trading for an All-Star.Thomas, acquired for pennies on the dollar, is that free agent.  He is that All-Star.Boston has gone 46-31 since he arrived in its lineup on Feb. 22, 2015.  It had gone 55-89 over the previous season and a half without him.That’s making an impact, and that’s why this wasn’t even a debate.Isaiah Thomas is an All-Star.

BOSTON – The first round of the 2011 NBA Draft was littered with trades, and one of them allowed the Boston Celtics to wind up snagging a dynamic duo of collegiate teammates.It was initially announced that the Celtics had made a local selection with the No. 25 pick by choosing Providence College standout Marshon Brooks.  Soon thereafter, though, it was announced that Boston had traded the rights to Brooks to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for the rights to former Purdue star JaJuan Johnson and a future second-round pick.Thirty picks later, Boston chose another Boilermaker – E'Twaun Moore.  The duo of Johnson and Moore combined to score nearly 53 percent of Purdue’s points during the 2010-11 NCAA season.Though Moore was certainly a score at No. 55, the talk of the night surrounded the acquisition of Johnson.  In moments, Boston went from adding a high-scoring guard (Brooks) to instead adding a high-scorer, who’s a winner (Johnson), to the frontcourt.  Johnson, who stands at 6-foot-10 and weighs 221 pounds, averaged 20.5 PPG and 8.6 RPG during his senior season at Purdue.  He finished his career tied for the most total wins of any player who has ever played at the university.Despite playing in a strong Big Ten conference last season, Johnson was a power from start to finish.  The end of his career couldn’t even put an end to his dominance.After concluding his senior season with a loss in the round of 32 of the NCAA tournament, Johnson was adorned with several high-profile accolades.  Those accolades speak for themselves: consensus First-Team AP All-American; Big Ten Player of the Year; Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year; First-Team All-Big Ten; and Big Ten All-Defensive Team.Impressive, to say the least.So how does a man with such an accomplished career slip to No. 27 in the Draft, where the Nets originally selected him?  The Celtics don’t have the answer to that question, but they were elated to watch it happen.“Yesterday we didn’t think he would be there, honestly, and he slipped to us,” said Doc Rivers.  “Who knows why, but he did.”The Celtics were clearly happy that he did, and for several reasons.Though Boston’s yearly title aspirations have been based on defense, for the first time maybe ever, all Rivers could talk about was offense when he spoke about Johnson.“Pick-and-pop – he’s a terrific shooter for his size,” Rivers said at the team’s Boston headquarters.  “He’s extremely athletic; obviously he rebounded well in college, which you hope translates over.  But we’ve proven we can get bigs shots, and so if we can get him shots, then he’ll make them.”Rivers went on to liken Johnson to a young version of three players who have had extremely successful NBA careers: Chris Bosh, Horace Grant, and, yes, Kevin Garnett.Though Boston’s head coach warned reporters not to compare Johnson and Garnett too closely, Rivers listed his reasons for making such a comment.“They’re very similar,” Rivers said of Johnson and Garnett.  “He’s not Kevin Garnett, alright?  So don’t write it, anybody.  But they are – same body type.  At the same time in their lives, [Johnson’s] probably a better shooter.”Despite all of the offensive talk, it’s difficult to ignore that Johnson was chosen as the top defensive player in the Big Ten last season.  That distinction was given to him over the likes of other shutdown defenders like David Lighty (Ohio State) and Jordan Taylor (Wisconsin).  Johnson led the Big Ten in blocked shots, with 73 total swats on the season.If Johnson was Batman this season at Purdue, Moore was his Robin.  The two were mentioned side-by-side all season long, and that continued into the postseason as well.  Moore joined Johnson on both the First-Team All-Big Ten roster and the Big Ten All-Defensive Team.While Johnson was making his living with a sweet touch and great athleticism, Moore was percolating on the perimeter.  As a 6-foot-4 guard who can take the ball off the dribble, Moore had a phenomenal senior season at Purdue that included averages of 18.0 PPG, 5.1 RPG and 3.2 APG.  He had a great shooting season as well, stroking the ball at a 44.7 percent clip from the field, 70.9 percent from the free-throw line and 40.0 percent from 3-point range.Johnson and Moore became one of the most feared duos in college basketball because they were dually able to get the job done at both ends of the court.  That’s a characteristic that stands out to Danny Ainge, who made the final call on both selections.“There’s guys that play great offense, there’s guys that are great defensive players, and there’s guys that we refer to as both-ends-of-the-court players,” Ainge stated.  “We think we got two of those guys.”Leading up to the draft, Ainge and Rivers both relayed realistic expectations that they probably wouldn’t draft any players who would make an immediate impact on their team.  By the end of Thursday night, that opinion may have changed thanks to a pair of accomplished collegiate teammates who will attempt to bring their bond – and impact – to Boston.
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics have been anxiously waiting to hit the parquet floor ever since their season came to an end in late May, when they fell to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals.There’s still two months to go until the 2018-19 regular season begins, but at least the C’s can begin marking up their calendars now that the NBA schedule has officially been released.With all 82 games mapped out, it’s time to take a look at some of the details that the upcoming six-month grind will entail.The Celtics opened last season on Oct. 17, marking their earliest start in 37 years. This season will tip off even sooner.Boston will set up shop Oct. 16 against the Philadelphia 76ers at TD Garden for its earliest regular-season start since Game 1 of the 1980-81 championship season.This opener is also unusual in that it will be followed by two days of rest. Boston typically has one or fewer days off following its first game, such as the last two seasons that both opened with a back-to-back. This time, however, the Celtics will be able to take a breather for a couple of days before heading up to Toronto for Game 2 on Oct. 19.Back-to-backs will be few and far between for the Celtics this season, again thanks to the early start. Boston will play on consecutive days just 12 times throughout the 2018-19 campaign, and none of those back-to-backs will combine for the previously-dreaded four-games in five-nights spell.With all of that said, the C’s will have to endure five back-to-backs during the first seven weeks of the season. Boston’s most grueling back-to-back distance-wise will be a 1,122-mile trek from Boston to Minneapolis between games against the Cleveland Cavaliers on Nov. 30 and the Minnesota Timberwolves on Dec. 1.The shortest distance covered in between back-to-backs will be a mere 69 miles. That’s how far the C’s will travel from Oakland to Sacramento between their matchups against the Warriors on March 5 and the Kings on March 6.The Celtics will get most of their extensive homestands and road trips out of the way before the calendar turns over to 2019.Boston’s longest road trip of the campaign will be a five-gamer beginning at the end of Week 3. The nine-day journey tips off Nov. 3 in Indianapolis, then it’s off to Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, respectively, before wrapping up Nov. 11 in Portland. Boston’s longest homestand will be a five-game stretch spanning from Jan. 21-30. Over the course of those 10 days, the C’s will host Miami, Cleveland, Golden State, Brooklyn and Charlotte, respectively, all while not having to leave the comforts of TD Garden.Aside from that, there will be only three other homestands and road trips that exceed three games. There will be two separate four-game homestands during an 11-game span from Dec. 19-Jan. 9. And there will be a four-game West Coast trip from March 5–11 that will include stops in Oakland, Sacramento and Los Angeles to face both the Lakers and the Clippers.For fans who can’t catch weeknight games because of work or school commitments, we have some good news for you: nearly half of Boston’s games this season fall on the weekend.The C’s will play 13 Friday night games, 18 Saturday games (one in the afternoon and 17 at night) and six Sunday games (two in the afternoon and four at night). That right there makes up 37 games of the season.As for the weekday schedule, the C’s will have 12 Monday matchups, nine Tuesday tilts, 15 Wednesday contests and nine Thursday contests.The Celtics have been gifted plenty of basketball for the upcoming holiday season.First up is a Christmas Day rivalry matchup between the Celtics and 76ers at TD Garden. One week later, the C’s will ring in 2019 with a New Year’s Eve battle in San Antonio. (Although, they’ll actually ring in the New Year from the stratosphere during their flight back to Boston.)Martin Luther King Jr. Day will be added back onto Boston’s schedule with a home matchup against the Miami Heat. It did not play on the holiday last season because of its London trip. Per usual, there will be no Celtics basketball on Thanksgiving, but the team will still have business to attend that day. The C’s will feast on their turkey up in the sky as they fly down to Atlanta to tip off a three-game road trip that begins on Black Friday.Boston will also have St. Patrick’s Day off, but fans can still watch their Green go for the gold the day before, as the C’s host the Hawks in a Saturday afternoon showdown.Typically, the Celtics have at least one jam-packed month per season. This season, there are none to be found.The highest monthly total of games that Boston will have to endure is 15. That number will be reached three times, during the months of November, January and March. Of the 15 games in January, a whopping 11 will be played at home. December will contain 14 games and February will carry just 11 contests, thanks to the All-Star break. The opening and closing months will feature the fewest number of regular season games, with October holding seven and April containing five, before heading into the Playoffs.The lightest months with be the opening month of October (seven games) and the closing month of April (five games). And that will take us right into the postseason.

WALTHAM, Mass. – It’s been a tale of two halves for the Boston Celtics during their last two games. They’ve had two straight sluggish starts followed by two energetic races to the finish, but have come up just short both times.As evidenced by those losses to the San Antonio Spurs and the Indiana Pacers, it’s difficult to win basketball games if you don’t start well.Celtics coach Brad Stevens held a quick 30-minute practice Thursday afternoon, hours after returning from Indianapolis, and focused on dissecting Boston’s early-game woes.“We’ve got to get tighten our first halves,” Stevens concluded. “Our first halves have been poor. We’ve turned the ball over and we have not gotten the same level of looks with the same amount of purpose that we have in the second.”He had his guys hit the film room on Thursday, and from that session Jared Sullinger said, “We realized our offense in the first half is nowhere near as good as our offense in the second half, and that’s a result of us moving the ball in the first half,” said Sullinger. “We’ve got to move the ball.”Marcus Smart, who sat out of Wednesday’s game as he rested a sprained toe, says the C's not only have to do a better job moving the ball, but must also maintain possession. He said their first-half turnover tendencies are coming back to bite them in the end. “Those turnovers cost us,” said Smart. “We’ve gotta crisp things up, and it starts with the pace. You set the tone early with how you run your offense and if it’s sloppy throughout the game, your game’s going to be sloppy.”Not being able to set the tone early has resulted in a difficult start for the C’s, but none of the guys are concerned heading forward. They understand they’re still mixing and matching lineups, they’re still growing accustomed to each others’ games, and their shots are bound to start falling.“We have a lot to improve and those areas are going to improve,” said Smart. “We just gotta keep working, those shots are going to fall, you just gotta keep shooting and don’t let our confidence get too low.”Boston is currently shooting just 40.2 percent from the field, which ranks 28th in the league, but rookie R.J. Hunter emphasized, “It’s early ... I think guys either make a lot of shots early or miss ‘em. It’s either one or the other, so law of averages: These guys are [going to] start making shots.”Sullinger agreed, saying, “It’s only four games in and we’ve got 78 more to go. We’re not really rushing, we’re not really worried about anything. We’re just going to move forward.”Their next step forward will take place Friday night, when they host a 3-1 Wizards squad, who have allowed opponents to shoot 45 percent against them through four games.Marcus Smart missed Wednesday’s game in Indiana with a sprained left big toe, and continued to rest up Thursday afternoon when his teammates hit the court for practice.Smart says he has no idea how the injury occurred, but he believes he will be back in action soon. “I’m feeling a little bit better,” said Smart. “Better than what I was [feeling] Tuesday , so that’s a good sign.“If I’m ready to go Friday then I’m gonna go. But if not, it’s early in the season so I’m not going to try to force anything and hopefully get me out there for Wednesday’s game.”The C’s are also hoping for a speedy recovery for Amir Johnson, who twisted his right ankle against the Pacers.Stevens called Johnson’s injury "day-to-day," and said he has a 50-50 chance of suiting up Friday against Washington.
SPRINGFIELD, Mass. – There were many illustrious moments that helped to shape Ray Allen’s Hall-of-Fame basketball career, but in his mind, there is one that stands high above all others: winning the 2008 NBA championship as a member of the Boston Celtics.After donning his orange jacket Thursday afternoon at the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Allen looked back on his time in Boston fondly, singling out the team’s banner season as the pinnacle of his career.“It was incredible because I didn’t know what it took to win a title,” said Allen, who will join 12 others Friday evening to be officially enshrined into the Hall-of-Fame. “Up until that point I thought I knew what it took. We talked about winning a championship, all of us, every player in the league. But until you win one, you look back and say, ‘Wow, I actually never knew that it would have been that hard. I had no idea.”Allen split 12 seasons between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Seattle SuperSonics aspiring to win a title, but it wasn’t until Year 13, when he joined Boston, that his dream was achieved. The Celtics had just come off of a 24-58 season in 2006-07 when Allen and fellow All-Star Kevin Garnett arrived in Beantown. However, those two players, along with Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo and a crew of believers turned the Celtics into a 66-16 team during the 2007-08 season, completing the biggest regular-season turnaround in NBA history.“it was something that will always be memorable because the team was the worst (in the Eastern Conference) the year before, and we went all the way to first the next year,” said Allen. “It was something none of us could ever imagine.”Allen went on to enjoy four more seasons in Boston, making another Finals appearance in 2010 and becoming the NBA’s king of 3-point makes, before joining the Miami Heat in the fall of 2012. His departure was difficult to handle for many in Celtics Nation, but the memories that he helped to create in Boston cannot be overlooked.“People look at how I left, but I look at how I lived while I was there,” said Allen. “That, to me, was the most important time in my life because I had never won, and there I was able to win. And that is probably the most important thing that I want people to always remember, is the time that we spent together.”The impact that Allen had on the Celtics organization is undeniable. His record-setting 3-point shot helped to carry the team to countless victories over the course of his tenure in green, and he will go down as one of the franchise’s greatest shooters of all time.Allen averaged 16.7 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game during five seasons in Boston, while also making 2.2 3-pointers per contest at a 40.9 percent clip. The NBA’s all-time leader in long-distance makes ranks third on Boston’s career 3-point list with 798 made 3s, trailing only Paul Pierce (1,823) and Antoine Walker (937). On top of that, he holds the franchise record for career free-throw percentage with an extraordinary rate of 91.4 percent.Allen’s greatest contribution, however, was his role in bringing Banner 17 to Boston. His clutch gene kicked in during the 2008 Finals, as he averaged 20.3 points per game while knocking down 52.4 percent of his 3-point attempts against the rival Los Angeles Lakers. Allen helped the Celtics finish off LA with a bang by scoring 26 points on a 7-of-9 effort from beyond the arc during Game 6, which clinched the title with a 131-92 win.Brining that ’08 championship to Boston is an accomplishment that Allen, his teammates and all of Celtics Nation will cherish forever. Winning that title, in Allen’s mind, was the defining moment of his career, as it helped carve out his path into the Hall-of-Fame.   

The Boston Celtics didn’t leave Brooklyn with a win Monday night, but they did get a career-high scoring effort out of their 20-year-old, sophomore wing. Despite his team’s 109-102 loss to the Nets, Jayson Tatum was the best all-around player on the court at Barclays Center. There, he erupted for 34 points on 12-of-19 shooting, while also tallying five rebounds, three assists and three blocks during 36 minutes of turnover-free basketball.It marked the first time in his young career that Tatum topped 30 points in a game, having previously come two points shy of the mark during Game 1 of the 2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals.  Much like in those Playoffs, he was relied upon Monday to take on a heavy scoring burden due to the absence of Kyrie Irving, who was suffering from a right quad contusion.Tatum also took on Irving’s role as the team’s go-to guy in crunch time, as he scored 15 points during the final frame to nearly lead the C’s to a 27-point comeback.This was the most dominant version of Tatum that we have ever seen, as he scored in a variety of ways, facilitated the offense at times and impacted the defensive end with his length and versatility. Tatum’s first bucket of the game came less than two minutes into the opening frame, and in dazzling fashion. Here, he receives a pass from Al Horford at the top of the arc, where he pump-fakes Treveon Graham out of his sneakers, before driving and splitting the defense for a layup high off the glass.Two and a half minutes later, Tatum hit a wide-open 3-pointer off of another dish from Horford, though that was the last field goal he’d score until the C’s final possession of the first half.With 11 seconds remaining in the second quarter, Tatum corrals a rebound and dribbles slowly up the right side of the court. Once he gets beyond the Nets’ logo, he explodes past a perimeter pick set by Robert Williams, then weaves his way around Jarrett Allen in the paint for a left-handed layup with 1.7 seconds remaining. That bucket pulled the Celtics within one point of the Nets entering halftime, before things went downhill for them in the third quarter. Tatum, however, was just getting warmed up.In the third quarter, Tatum knocked down four field goals, which was one more than he made during the entire first half. His first bucket out of the break is a display of power, as he battles through contact in the low post against Rodions Kurucs and banks in a layup.Then, Tatum began to show off his soft touch. Here, he spins around Kurucs and tosses a high floater over the outstretched arm of Allen.That soft touch comes into play again a few minutes later, this time with a high bank shot off the glass that Tatum shovels over Allen’s fingertips.He then closes out the third quarter in similar fashion as he did the second, by bursting past a perimeter screen set on Carroll, before finishing over Allen with a speedy layup.The fourth quarter was by far Tatum’s best frame of the game. During just eight minutes, he managed to score 15 points on a 5-for-7 clip from the field and a perfect 3-for-3 clip from the free-throw line.The fourth quarter is also when Tatum hit two of his three triples on the night, including this tough, corner trey over a strong close-out by Joe Harris.Later in the frame, Tatum delivers his most impressive move of the game on this crossover, step-back jumper that puts Carroll on skates. It was on this bucket that Tatum hit the 30-point mark.When he wasn’t crossing up opponents or hitting from long range, Tatum was driving to the rim at will. He shot 5-of-6 from within the restricted area, and his constant driving also helped him to earn a career-high-tying 11 trips to the free-throw line, where he would knock down 7 shots.Here’s his final rim-run of the night, as weaves past a screen and crosses up Carroll once again, before barreling to the basket for an explosive finish.Despite the career-high effort, Tatum was more focused on his team's loss than on his individual prowess.“I’ll score plenty of 30-point games in my career,” he confidently told reporters after the game. “So, I’m not worried about that.”
BOSTON – Around midway through the first round of Thursday night’s NBA Draft, Texas A&M big man Robert Williams became a hot topic of conversation among the Boston Celtics’ front office brass while they were huddled around a table inside the “War Room” at the Auerbach Center.A unique blend of length, athleticism and rim protection skills allowed the 6-foot-10, 240-pound 20-year-old to land on Boston’s radar, and the organization was ready to pounce if he dropped all the way down to their lone pick, late in the first round. “There's a lot of good players out there,” said C’s coach Brad Stevens, “and each pick we were hoping more and more that he would be available at 27.”Team after team passed on Williams, before he eventually fell right into Boston’s lap. The made the call to the league without hesitation, officially welcoming Williams into their brotherhood.What was it that sold the Celtics on Williams? Well, it was a large combination of NBA-level attributes according to Stevens, who spoke with the media moments after the pick was made.“When you look at guys with size and how they can impact the game now – he’s got good feet, he’s a good athlete, he’s got a 7-foot-5 wingspan and he plays way above the rim,” said Stevens, while listing off Williams’ strengths.  “And his ability to block shots, the ability to alter shots, the quickness to catch up, to guard shooters if they get a step, being able to still alter that. And then obviously if you can have four shooters on the floor and have a guy like that rolling to the rim, you can just throw it up in the air and he can go get it and finish it.”Williams averaged 11.1 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game during his two seasons with the Aggies, while playing 25.7 minutes per contest. He was downright dominant on the glass with an offensive rebounding rate of 11.9 percent and a defensive rebounding rate of 24.0 percent.Interestingly, the Celtics did not work out Williams at their practice facility as they did with roughly 60 other prospects. But that doesn’t mean the front office didn’t do their homework on the prospect.“Nobody works harder than Danny (Ainge), nobody works harder than our front office at going and watching players play live all year long,” explained Stevens. “The workouts to them are just a formality in a lot of ways, so the idea of them coming to Boston is great and all, but they’ve already watched him play live a bunch and have spent time with a lot of their coaches and people around the program.”What Ainge and the rest of Boston’s talent evaluators discovered while scouting Williams was that he possessed a bunch of characteristics that the Celtics were somewhat lacking.One area that Williams needs to improve upon is his shooting ability, but he still has a lot to offer on the offensive end in the meantime. He excels in the pick-and-roll, is great at converting on lob passes, and, to the delight of Stevens, has shown signs of becoming a strong playmaker.“As far as handling and passing, I think he’s actually got a good foundation there,” said Stevens. “I think that he will improve his shot and get right to work on that, but handling and passing, I think he’ll be able to do that and be able to continue to get better at it. We put a lot of time into ball handling with our bigs, from Day 1 once they get here.”Day 1 for Williams is set for June 29. That is when he is scheduled to be formally introduced to the team at their new training facility, and that will be his first opportunity to slip on his new green and white uniform.And from there, the NBA grind begins for the newest member of the Celtics. 
BOSTON – Jaylen Brown spent his rookie season in 2016-17 grinding away for minutes and proving his worth to the Boston Celtics. All of his hard work paid off by the time his sophomore campaign rolled around, earning a promotion to the C’s starting lineup and quickly becoming recognized as one of the premier two-way players in the league.Brown’s numbers vastly improved all across the board from his first season to his second, more than doubling his averages in points, assists, steals and blocks. In just one season, the 6-foot-7 wing transitioned from an inconsistent role player off the bench to one of the most reliable all-around players on the team, which is why he has earned our Most Improved Player award.As a rookie, Brown averaged 6.6 points, 2.8 rebounds and 0.8 assists per game, while playing 17.2 minutes per contest. He showed some flashes of greatness along the way, but didn’t really get the opportunity to shine until the start his sophomore season, when was asked to step up right away in the face of adversity.When Gordon Hayward went down with a season-ending leg injury five minutes into the season-opener, Brown took it upon himself to help fill the void. While battling the emotions of losing his teammate in gruesome fashion that night, he scored a career-high 25 points to lead all Celtics scorers. From that moment, it was clear that Brown’s game and focus level had reached new heights. Sure enough, it only marked the beginning of what would be an outstanding individual campaign.The scoring department was where Brown improved most from Year 1 to Year 2. He became a dominant slasher in the lane, while also upping his 3-point percentage from 34.1 percent to 39.5 percent. Brown reached the 20-point mark 16 times over the course of the season, after doing so just once during his rookie campaign. And his 14.5 PPG ranked second on the team, trailing only Kyrie Irving.Brown also saw his rebounding average climb to 4.8 RPG. And he boosted his passing mark to 1.6 APG. These increases were largely thanks to his spike in minutes, as he played 30.7 MPG, nearly doubling his playing time as a rookie.Brown even showed improvements as the season went along, particularly in the free-throw department. The 21-year-old struggled at the charity stripe during the first half of the season, making just 56.2 percent of his freebies through his first 40 games. He corrected the issue mid-season by adjusting his breathing technique and went on to shoot 76.0 percent from the line for the remainder of the regular season.Brown also saw some great improvements on the other side of the ball. He was counted on regularly to guard the opposing team’s best player, and he never backed down from a challenge. The lockdown perimeter defender tied for seventh in the NBA with 3.8 defensive win shares and helped Boston secure the No. 1 defensive rating in the league.Brown stepped up even more come playoff time, taking on a heavier scoring load to help the Celtics get by without Hayward and Kyrie Irving, who also sustained a season-ending injury. The Georgia native averaged 18.0 PPG during the postseason, scoring 25 points or more on four different occasions. His offensive contributions helped lead the C’s all the way to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals, before falling to the Cleveland Cavaliers.Brown was not only the most improved Celtics player from last year to this year, but he also showed some of the greatest in-season refinements on the team as well. From the start of the season to the end of the Playoffs, Brown’s development arc continued to rise, indicating that he still has even more room to improve as he transitions from Year 2 to Year 3.
In 1957, 8-year-old Dan Klores introduced himself to playing the game of basketball. Instantly, he fell in love.Using only a dodgeball and the bottom rung of a Brooklyn schoolyard fire escape, Klores and a friend exercised their innocent imaginations and wandered off into fantasy.  “We escaped,” Klores, now an award-winning director and producer, recalled in an interview with Celtics.com. “And as children do, they pretend. Right off the bat, one of us was Bill Russell and one of us was Bob Pettit.“This,” Klores explained, “is where I fell in love for the first time – before there was a girl.”Unlike many love affairs, this one never died out. Klores’ obsession for the game only intensified as he grew older, and it ultimately inspired him to create the work of his life: “Basketball: A Love Story,” which is set to premiere at 7 p.m. Tuesday night on ESPN. The 10-part, 20-hour documentary is comprised of 62 short stories, which collectively portray the evolution of basketball in a non-linear, yet logical fashion. To create the film, Klores and his crew compiled roughly 500 hours of interviews with 165 basketball legends from the NBA, ABA, college basketball, women’s basketball and the international hoops scene.“It’s intricate, it’s tender and there’s tons of new revelations,” claimed Klores.The documentary should appeal to all types of basketball fans, but particularly to supporters of the Boston Celtics. Many of the short stories revolve around, or touch upon the NBA’s most renowned organization.Although he is a native New Yorker, Klores has always had utmost respect for the Celtics and everything they stand for as an organization. So, he made sure to have the franchise to play an integral role in his film, with it featuring 26 interview subjects who were all involved with the C’s at some point in their respective careers.“I consider the Celtics to be a revolutionary entity,” said Klores. “I think they’ve had the greatest positive impact on professional basketball, period. “Now, I’m not talking about the first to do this and the first to do that; what I mean is that they did things largely in the way that a champion in life is to do things. That, to me, is the legacy of the Celtics.”Former team beat writers Jackie MacMullen and Bob Ryan came on board to help with the interviewing process of former Celtic greats, but Klores saved the film’s most glorified subject for himself.Bringing his love story in full circle, Klores sat down with Bill Russell for a five-and-a-half-hour interview session. The 11-time NBA champion went into elaborate detail about everything from his challenging upbringing, to the racial tension he faced throughout his NBA career.From this interview, Klores was able to pluck out what is perhaps the most intriguing bit of information from the entire film, which he shared with Celtics.com.“I have a whole story on what’s called the ‘Genius Gene,’” explained Klores. “And my question is: When you’re that great – when you’re Russell, or Michael Jordan – are you born with the genius gene, or is this a gift that you just develop?“So, I asked Russell that and he says that he doesn’t consider himself a genius. But, he says, ‘For many years, I remembered every play of every game I ever played.’ Now, what is that if not a form of genius?”Along with Russell, the film features interviews with Celtics Legends such as Larry Bird, Bob Cousy, Dave Cowens, John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, Don Nelson, Paul Pierce, Satch Sanders, Bill Walton, and many others. Through this dialogue, viewers gain exclusive access to insight on some of the greatest triumphs in Celtics history. For example, it dives deep into Boston's first NBA title against the St. Louis Hawks in 1957, highlighting the Russell-Pettit rivalry, which, later that same year, would play a major role in forging Klores' relationship with basketball. The film also freshly details Boston's unparalleled rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, and it explores the revitalization of the organization in 2007 with the construction of its Big 3 super team.Basketball: A Love Story reminds all basketball fans why they fell in love with the game in the first place, just like Klores did more than 60 years ago in a Brooklyn park, where he and his friend escaped reality to become Celtics and Hawks legends.This love story brings us closer than ever to those legends who helped establish our relationship with basketball, and it offers plenty of reasons to love it even more.
Boston won the lottery but flipped the top pick to Philadelphia in exchange for the rights to the No. 3 pick and a future first-rounder. The C’s went on to select Jayson Tatum and all he did was go on to put together one of the most incredible postseason runs by a rookie in NBA history, averaging a team-best 18.5 points per game on 47.1 percent shooting for a team that reached the brink of the Finals. He is now considered by many to be a future superstar who is untouchable on the trade market.Semi Ojeleye, who began his collegiate career at Duke and finished it at SMU, fell to the C’s at No. 37 and Boston couldn’t be any happier. As a rookie on a title contender, Ojeleye carved out a role as a 3-and-D player with his versatile defensive skill set and his respectable 3-point shot. He should have a role in the league for a long time.The Celtics chose to invest the 53rd overall pick in Kadeem Allen, a defensive-minded guard out of Arizona. Allen is now a two-way player for Boston.Jabari Bird signed a two-way contract with Boston and appeared in 13 games, including one during the first week of the season in Philadelphia when his 13-plus minutes of action helped to spark the team’s first win of the season.Jaylen Brown has quickly garnered attention from around the league as a potential future All-Star. After contributing as a rookie off the bench with his elite athleticism, he stepped into the starting lineup as a sophomore and bumped his scoring average from 6.6 PPG to 14.5 PPG, and his 3-point shooting from 34.1 percent to 39.5 percent. He is everything a team could hope for out of a No. 3 pick.With eight picks and not enough room on the roster for all of them, Boston prioritized draft-and-stash players. Guerschon Yabusele was the first selection. He played the following season in China before joining the C’s for the 2017-18 season. The C’s are still working to develop him.Ante Zizic was the second draft-and-stash player who played overseas for a season after being drafted. A 7-footer from Croatia, Zizic played well for Boston’s 2017 Summer League team before being included in the team’s trade for Kyrie Irving. Zizic was an end-of-bench player for the Cavaliers this season.These players were drafted and immediately traded by Boston to Memphis for a future 2019 first-round pick (via the LA Clippers).The Celtics waived Ben Bentil four months after drafting him. He went on to sign with the Pacers, and then the Mavericks, but is now playing overseas.Abdel Nader spent his first year with Boston’s G-League team, the Maine Red Claws, where he earned Rookie of the Year honors, all before joining the Celtics for the 2017-18 season. He appeared in 48 games and showed promise as an offensive threat.Danny Ainge surprised many by drafting Terry Rozier as high as he did, but Rozier has consistently improved and was Boston’s starting point guard throughout this year’s postseason run to Game 7 of the Eastern Finals. He is now regarded as a starter-level point guard in the league.R.J. Hunter spent his first season with Boston before being waived the following offseason. Hunter most recently played on a two-way contract for the Houston Rockets this season.Boston drafted Jordan Mickey and quickly gave him a record-breaking deal for a second-round pick. He played a small role in Boston for two seasons before being waived in the summer of 2017 to create roster space. He then signed on with the Miami Heat and started three games for them this season.Marcus Thornton played on two of Boston’s Summer League teams but has never appeared in the NBA. He played this past season for the Canton Charge of the G-League.Marcus Smart has proven himself to be a top-notch defender in the NBA whose energy can alter the course of games. He has also improved his offensive playmaking abilities. He is scheduled to become a restricted free agent this summer, and many teams – including Boston – will be interested in his services.James Young spent his first three seasons with the Celtics before the team chose not to pick up the final year of his rookie contract. He since signed with the Milwaukee Bucks and the Philadelphia 76ers but was waived by both teams before the end of this season.Boston traded the rights to Lucas Nogueira and two second-rounders to Dallas for the rights No. 13 overall pick Kelly Olynyk. Olynyk played four strong seasons with the C’s, including a clutch 26-point performance during Game 7 of the Conference Semifinals in 2017. He since signed a four-year, $50-million deal with Miami as a playmaking, 3-point shooting big.
LAS VEGAS – Jaylen Brown was watching the Summer Celtics take on the New York Knicks Thursday afternoon in Las Vegas, but his mind was back in Boston in the rafters of TD Garden.Brown, who watched the game with a Celtics contingency that included Kyrie Irving, spoke to the media at halftime of Boston’s 82-75 win over New York. While doing so, he made multiple mentions of his team’s goal for next season: to add to its record collection of 17 championships.“We’ve got a lot of great talent on this team, with a great coach,” he confidently stated, “so we’re thinking we’re trying to raise a banner.”Confidence clearly isn’t an issue for Brown and the Celtics, who are riding high toward next season. A team that advanced to Game 7 of the Eastern Finals is primed to return All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward to the lineup. They are stacked with talent, and they are the odds-on favorites to win the Eastern Conference.Some claim that last fact is a result of LeBron James exiting the East this summer to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers. Brown takes exception to such a notion.“I don’t like when people say, ‘Now that LeBron’s gone, now you’re the favorite,’” he said, clearly irritated by the idea. “That hurts me. A lot of us, we feel the same, because we feel like whether he was there or if he wasn’t there, we were coming.”Brown doesn’t like the fact that he and his teammates are now forced to go around James, rather than facing him head-on during the Eastern Conference Playoffs.“To be honest, I wanted him to stay (in Cleveland),” Brown stated. “I wanted to be the team to go through him.”Instead, Boston will now go through the likes of Indiana, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Toronto as it aspires to capture its first berth into the Finals since 2010.While Brown is upset about the fact that the best player in the world has moved out west, he is dedicating the majority of his attention toward what he and his teammates can do to better themselves. Brad Stevens often preaches to his players that they must “control the controllables” and only worry about themselves. That’s the mindset that Brown is taking with him as he navigates through the offseason.“We just want to be the best team that we can be. Right now, that’s what we’re thinking,” he said. “We just want to continue to get better. We don’t know what the final roster is, so right now we’re just trying to be the best version of ourselves and bring that to the table.“We’ve got to make sure we take care of ourselves,” he continued. “Eat healthy, and start for the long haul. We’ve got to start thinking now, rather than start thinking later.”Clearly, Brown has already given plenty of thought to next season. He’s preparing his body and his mind to compete at the highest of levels.For him, Game 7 of the Eastern Finals wasn’t enough. He has only one thing on his mind, and that’s Banner 18.
LAS VEGAS – The Summer Celtics advanced to the second round of the Las Vegas Summer League tournament by downing the Knicks 82-75 Thursday afternoon at UNLV’s Thomas & Mack Center.The Celtics are now 3-1 during Summer League play and will take on the Miami Heat at 6:30 p.m. ET Saturday evening in the second round of the tournament.Boston led by as many as 21 during the win but needed to fend off a Knicks comeback attempt during the fourth quarter to grab the victory. New York outscored the Celtics 25-17 during the final period and at one point clawing back to within four points, but Boston scored every time it needed to in order to maintain a two-possession lead and to finish off the win. “Just a credit to the guys we have on this team, being calm in that situation,” said Semi Ojeleye, who scored a game-high 21 points. “It started with Jay (Larranaga) telling us just to relax, and realize they were going to make their run at some point and we just had to take it and respond.”The Celtics responded during the biggest sequence of the game, while New York fumbled away a chance to make it a one-possession game and put more pressure on Boston.Leading by four with less than three minutes remaining, Celtics guard Pierria Henry drove down the lane and attempted a left-handed layup over Mitchell Robinson. Robinson, however, rose up and swatted the shot away with his own left hand for his sixth block of the game.Two Knicks were in position to grab the rebound, which would have given New York possession of the ball with 2:32 remaining and a chance to make it a one-possession game at the other end of the floor. However, those two players fought each other for the rebound and wound up losing the ball completely.The ball bounced right into the hands of Jabari Bird, who was standing nearby and under the basket, and he dropped in an uncontested layup from the left side of the rim to push Boston’s lead back up to six.New York would climb no closer than to within five points the rest of the way.Ojeleye was the highlight of the game from Boston’s perspective. Not only did he lead the game in scoring while shooting 8-for-16 from the field and 4-for-9 from long range, but he also added in six rebounds and a game’s worth of lockdown defense.The premier matchup heading into this game was Ojeleye versus Knicks rookie Kevin Knox. Knox entered the contest averaging 23.3 points per game, and he was getting to the free-throw line for an average of 7.3 attempts per game in Vegas.Ojeleye played a key role in stopping those trends, as he put the clamps down on Knox to limit the high-scoring wing to 15 points on 5-for-20 shooting, with only four attempts from the free-throw line.“Excellent,” Larranaga said to describe Ojeleye’s defense against Knox. “I thought he really was able to get into airspace and not give up penetration.”Ojeleye was one of three Celtics who scored in double-figures. Jabari Bird added in 13 points to go along with 10 rebounds, four assists and three steals, and Guerschon Yabusele tallied 12 points, five rebounds and two blocked shots.The Celtics will have Friday completely off before they return to action Saturday evening. They will be taking on a Heat team that is 2-2 in Vegas, with wins over New Orleans and Utah, and losses to New Orleans and Charlotte.
LAS VEGAS – The Summer Celtics went 4-2 in Las Vegas. That record accurately indicates that there was far more good than bad to see out of this team during the MGM Resorts Summer League.Below are some general observations we took from Boston’s 11-day stay on The Strip.We were fortunate enough to be granted a full day of access to Boston’s Summer League coaching staff. One thing we learned during that time was that Jay Larranaga, who served as the team’s head coach, can command a room. It’s important for a coach to be able to command respect, and also to be able to teach players, both in the film room and on the court, in a concise manner. They must explain things quickly, and in an easily digestible format. Larranaga does all of that, and his players knew exactly what was expected of them on this team.Guerschon Yabusele had some great moments and some questionable moments during Summer League play. The good news is that there were more of the former than of the latter. Boston wants to be able to use Yabusele as a playmaking big man, and Yabusele made some very impressive plays for teammates during his stay in Vegas. He also closed out shooting the ball well Sunday night, when he scored 16 points and shot 4-for-7 from long distance. Yabusele is still developing, and people must understand that. Remember, no one thought Marcus Smart or Terry Rozier were going to be who they are now after they played in their second Summer Leagues. Yabusele showed signs of growth in Vegas, but he still has a lot of room left to improve. He needs more time – and more NBA reps – to fulfil his potential.No player on Boston’s roster made more noise than Bird, who is currently a restricted free agent. He was outstanding during his four games in Vegas, averaging 16.8 points, 6.0 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.8 steals per game, all while shooting 57.0 percent from the field. He scored in every possible way, from athletic drives and finishes, to pull-up jumpers, to canning 3-pointers. He did not play during Boston’s final two games, but he didn’t need to. He already opened eyes all around the league with his all-around game, and he’ll surely be receiving plenty of calls once the league departs its annual stay in Vegas.Summer League unfortunately was not a very opportunistic experience for rookie big man Rob Williams. Williams played only seven minutes during Boston’s first game in Vegas before suffering a left leg contusion that kept him out of the next five games. He was able to work out privately with the coaching staff, but missing out on game action certainly put a damper on his first few weeks with the team.Trey Davis plays with a great pace, never being sped up by opponents, but always probing the defense for driving and passing lanes. He didn’t play during the first couple of games, but when he did finally get the call, he answered by playing well. He’s not an elite shooter, but he is great at breaking a defense down and creating shots for himself or for teammates. Davis, who grew up with Marcus Smart, also plays as hard as Smart does while he’s on the court. It’s hard not to like that.A few players on this team would fit in just fine on a football team. Hassan Martin is one of them. Martin is a bulky and strong 6-foot-7 forward who showed high-level talent around the basket. He’s a true back-to-the-basket type player who can finish with both hands. The problem is that he’s only 6-foot-7. Still, he was one of the brightest spots on the team among players who are not signed to the C’s. He averaged 10.0 points and 6.0 rebounds per game despite playing only 18.7 minutes per game. 
LAS VEGAS – Clutch offense and strong team defense helped the Celtics to overcome 40 points from Philadelphia’s Furkan Korkmaz and down the Sixers 95-89 Friday night. The contest marked the opening game of each team’s slate in the Las Vegas Summer League.Boston outscored Philadelphia 10-2 during the final minutes to capture the win. Guerschon Yabusele scored five of his 16 points during that stretch, which included a game-clinching 3-pointer from the right wing that beat the shot clock and gave the Celtics a 93-87 advantage.Philadelphia’s inability to score down the stretch was a microcosm of the struggles it experienced all night. The Celtics swallowed up every Sixers player not named Korkmaz, who shot 8-for-14 from long distance and 12-for-15 from the free-throw line; the rest of the Sixers combined to shoot a woeful 31.0 percent from the field.The Celtics offense was at the opposite end of the spectrum. Boston shot 48.6 percent from the field while seven players made at least three field goals.Yabusele and fellow sophomore Semi Ojeleye were at the forefront of the C’s scoring. Each player accounted for 16 points while making six field goals apiece. Ojeleye scored 13 of his points during the first half, while Yabusele came through in the clutch by scoring 10 of his points during the second half.Friday’s opener marked each player’s first chance to play in an expanded role for the Celtics. Ojeleye was a 3-and-D specialist for Boston last season, while Yabusele played the majority of his minutes in Maine with the Red Claws. With the Summer C’s, however, they are two of the featured offensive options on the team.“It’s a great opportunity,” Ojeleye said after the win. “That’s why I’m here, to try to expand my game and get more comfortable so that when the season comes I can try to add that to my game and try to help offensively as well as defensively.”While Ojeleye and Yabusele helped the team at both ends Friday night, Boston’s victory didn’t come with any sort of ease. The two teams went back and forth throughout the game, with neither side pulling ahead by more than 11 points during the contest. The C’s led by 11 early on in the third quarter, but by the time the fourth rolled around, that lead has been trimmed to six, at 69-63.The fourth quarter was a back-and-forth battle that featured three ties and four lead changes. Boston fell behind 84-80 after Korkmaz nailed his final 3-pointer of the game, but the C’s then responded to tie the game at 85-85 before finishing the night on their game-clinching, 10-2 run.“We showed a resilience,” said Celtics Summer League head coach Jay Larranaga. “When we got down, we just kept playing.”In addition to the team’s resiliency, Larranaga also commended its professional nature. Hassan Martin, who scored eight of Boston’s final 18 points after not recording a point during the first three quarters of the game, was at the forefront of that march.“I think it’s the message we said in the locker room,” Larranaga said of what Martin’s contribution meant to the team. “We talked about: This Summer League is very similar to an NBA season, where you don’t know when your opportunity is going to come, but it’s going to come. Hassan was ready. Just a great example of professionalism and just always being ready when you’re called on.”Boston likely would have lost this game without Martin’s contributions, and with that in mind, there may have been no better path for the Celtics to log their opening-game victory. Their players answered the bell when they were called upon, they hit clutch shots, and they defended at a high level.That’s the recipe for success during Summer League action – a recipe Boston has now seen work, and one it will aim to carry into its next contest at 11 p.m. EST Saturday night against the Denver Nuggets.
BOSTON – Ahead of Saturday night’s tip-off in Atlanta, Celtics coach Brad Stevens told the media how much his team was in need of a grind-it-out win on the road, after losing four straight and six of its last seven away from home. It’s almost as if his players were listening from around the corner inside the visitor’s locker room at State Farm Arena, as they came out and did exactly what Stevens asked.Things weren’t so hot for Boston at the start, as could be expected for a team playing on the second night of a back-to-back. The C’s surrendered 67 points to the Hawks during the first half and trailed by as many as 16 points. But during the second half, and particularly in the fourth quarter, the Celtics looked like a totally different team.Boston dug deep during the final frame of its third game in four nights and began to make defensive stops. Its offense, meanwhile, picked up the pace, as the C’s dominated the final 12 minutes, 30-16, en route to a 113-105, comeback win.It wasn’t pretty, but it sure was gritty. And that’s exactly the type of win Boston needed to boost its morale, having entered Saturday with a 2-5 mark when playing on the second night of a back-to-back.“We needed that kind of response compared to what we have done in the last few opportunities on back-to-backs,” Stevens reflected after the game. “No question about that.” The Celtics came into the matchup knowing that they’d be in for quite a test against the Hawks. They didn’t put much stock into Atlanta’s 14-30 record, given that the Hawks had won eight of their last 15 games, the last two of which came against a pair of powerhouses in Philadelphia and Oklahoma City.“We knew that they were waiting for us and that they would be ready tonight, as they came out really aggressive early in the game,” said Al Horford, who logged 13 points, nine rebounds and two blocked shots.The only reason Boston was able to stick with Atlanta through the first half was because Kyrie Irving put its offense on his back and poured in 23 points ahead of the break. Fortunately, Irving, who finished with 32 points, didn’t have to maintain that pace throughout the entire contest, as the Celtics defense began to find its groove.During the fourth quarter, the C’s went on a pair of massive runs – a 14-2 run at the start of the frame and a 14-5 run to end the game. Those runs were made possible because of the defensive energy provided by both Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier.“I thought Terry was great tonight,” Stevens said of his second-string point guard who logged nine points, a career-high-tying 11 rebounds, four assists and three steals. “He struggled to shoot the ball for the first three quarters but I thought his energy and Jaylen’s energy, specifically in the late third and early fourth quarter, were pivotal for our team.”Getting those types of efforts are hard to come by on the second night of a back-to-back, especially in the final quarter. Though, Brown and Rozier clearly were just as hungry as Stevens was for one of these types of victories.“In the second half we really guarded, and I thought we showed some tired legs shooting the ball, but we were just gritty and we found a way to win,” Stevens said. “That’s a good win and those are hard to come by, and I think that’s one of those things about this league and that is that you have to earn every one of them.”The Celtics certainly earned this road win, and it should keep their spirits high as they head back to Boston for a season-long, five-game homestand starting Monday night against Miami.
BOSTON – Red Auerbach. Tom Heinsohn. Doc Rivers. K.C. Jones.Those four men represented the only coaches in Celtics history who had reached the 250 regular-season win mark with the organization prior to Monday night.After a 107-99 win over the Miami Heat, Brad Stevens can add his name to that elite list, as well.It took Stevens a little more than five and a half seasons to hit the milestone, and he did so while coaching a number of unique Celtics teams, from its rebuilding stage to its now potentially title-contending stage.“I think he’s done great, not just with this team, but over the last five or six years just getting everything out of the groups that he’s had,” said Kyrie Irving, who did his part to help Stevens reach the mark Monday night by tallying 26 points, 10 assists and a career-high eight steals. “He came in here on a rebuilding situation and really put his mark on the teams he had, and I ended up playing him them three times in the playoffs (as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers). So, it’s great to see the success he’s had. Super proud of him to get his 250th win.”Attaining the quarter-thousand mark with one team is difficult to do in the modern-day NBA, where the head coaching job is like a revolving door. Heat coach Erik Spoelstra can appreciate what Stevens has accomplished, as he is one of the six other active coaches who has earned 250 victories with his current squad.“We wish there were more places like Boston that have great ownership, management, stability, that know how tough this profession of coaching is,” said Spoelstra, who has a franchise-record 506 regular-season wins with the Heat over a span of 10 and a half seasons. “Then you add an extremely talented coach like Brad, there’s a reason why they’ve had banners and why they’ve had success. You have to have continuity and consistency and particularly when times get tough. They’ve had tough times and they’ve been able to weather those and be able to take the benefits from this. Brad is a tremendous coach and he’s been a great addition to the league bringing in a college background. He’s done a phenomenal job with a lot of different teams here.”The first Celtics team that Stevens coached in 2013-14 won just 25 games. It was during that season that he realized just how tough it was to win in the NBA. Fortunately, things went uphill for him and the franchise after that.In 2014-15, Boston’s win total skyrocketed to 40, as it squeezed into the Playoffs as the East's seventh seed. The next year, it won 48 and nabbed the fifth seed. In 2015-16, that number climbed to 53, earning the Celtics the No. 1 seed in the conference. And last season, they improved ever so slightly to 55 wins, while placing second in the East.In the process, Stevens became just the second coach in NBA history to increase his winning percentage annually over his first five full seasons with the same team, joining Mike Woodson who did so for six straight seasons with the Atlanta Hawks.With all of that being said, reaching the 250-mark is an accomplishment that Stevens never imagined he’d achieve with the Celtics. “When you’re in coaching,” Stevens said, “you never think you’re going to get one (win), and you’re always like, ‘How do you possibly get the next one?’ So, I haven't even thought about it. It's just an honor to coach here and to get a chance to coach in this league against coaches like Erik Spoelstra.”It was only eight wins ago, that Stevens passed Bill Fitch for fifth place on the Boston’s all-time wins list. The 42-year-old is now 58 wins victories shy of Jones, who owned a remarkable 308-102 record during just five seasons at the Celtics’ helm.In third place sits Rivers with 416, and slightly ahead of him is Heinsohn with 427. Way ahead in first place, of course, is Auerbach with 795. 
BOSTON – Truth be told, Terry Rozier was unstoppable Wednesday night. At least during the first half, as he helped the Celtics put away the Cleveland Cavaliers at TD Garden with Paul Pierce-esque perfection.Rozier erupted for 22 points on 8-of-8 shooting before the break, making him the first Boston player to log 20-plus points on a perfect shooting clip since Paul Pierce’s 20-point, 7-of-7 second-half effort against the Chicago Bulls on Oct. 30, 2009, according to Elias Sports Bureau.Filling the void of an ill Kyrie Irving in the starting lineup, Rozier erupted for 16 points out of the gate, accounting for more than half of Boston’s 27 points during the opening frame.“He started it off,” said Jaylen Brown, who scored 23 points off the bench – including 14 during the second half of Boston’s 123-103 win. “Terry’s one of the best guards in the league if you ask me. When he comes out with that aggression, no one can stop him.”Rozier stayed hot all the way through to the end of the second quarter, as he hit a buzzer-beating, 31-foot bomb to send the C’s into the break with a 65-50 lead. From there, Boston cruised to a 20-point win behind Rozier’s season-best, and game-high, 26-point effort.“That’s Terry, just being aggressive,” Brown reiterated. “It looked like he was having fun out there, just being aggressive, playing hard. That’s what he can do.”Rozier knew he’d have to fill a scoring void as soon as Irving texted him Wednesday morning, telling his backup point guard that he’d be too sick to suit up that night against his former team.“He makes it tough for me,” Rozier joked after the game. “Because all them points he’s scoring in the first quarter, first half, so when I come out there it’s like, ‘Damn.’ It put a lot of pressure on me. But I just want to go out there and be effective whether I’m coming off the bench or starting.”No matter his role, Rozier’s been making the most of his minutes of late. It hasn’t always come in the form of high-volume scoring, but he’s been an outstanding boost of energy for Boston during its five-game winning streak.“I think Terry’s played, not only well tonight, but the better part of the last few games he’s been very good,” C’s coach Brad Stevens said. “I’ve been really encouraged by him.  He’s a great guy with his work ethic, his desire to get better.  He never says a word about the days he doesn’t start.  He just comes in, tries to play his hardest, so (I’m) really encouraged.”Rozier’s first half was about as encouraging as could be. He made all four of his shots outside the 3-point arc, all four of his shots inside the arc, and both of his shots from the free-throw line. On top of that, he dished out three of his game-high-tying six assists ahead of the break, while also corralling three of his team-high-tying eight rebounds.“Just going out there, I had high confidence, was just playing free,” Rozier said. “When I’m like that,” he added before pausing with a smile. “I don’t even want to say it…”It’s OK, Terry. We’ll say it for you – you’re unstoppable when you play like that.That’s the truth.
CLEVELAND – The Boston Celtics have something that nearly every other NBA team does not: absurd depth.That depth was on full display during Tuesday’s 103-96 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.Boston played without two starters in Kyrie Irving and Marcus Morris, but used three other starter-level players to fill their shoes. The trio of Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward and Terry Rozier, all of whom are full-time reserves for the Celtics, combined for 39 points, 18 rebounds, nine assists and five steals during the victory.Boston’s red-hot offense also remained maintained its production level while that trio garnered major minutes. The Celtics shot 48.8 percent from the field and tallied 29 assists on the night.“They didn’t miss a beat,” Marcus Smart said of Brown, Hayward and Rozier stepping into heightened roles. “And that’s what makes us so dangerous, that we have depth in that aspect, where we can bring guys off the bench and we can sit guys, or we can go without guys, and guys are going to step up and have a good game.”Guys oftentimes step up for other teams when starters miss games. The difference in Boston is that the C’s have the luxury of replacing their injured starters with players who would be starting for many teams around the league.“That lineup, we’re young, but we were very battle-tested last year,” said Tatum, who scored a team-high 25 points. “We know everybody has each other’s backs, and everybody’s fighting for one another. We can count on each other no matter [what].”They could also count on Hayward on this night, as he came off the bench as a super-sub to provide 18 points, six rebounds, five assists, a steal and a blocked shot. Hayward is not just a starter-level player; he is a former All-Star who started every game he played in during the previous five NBA seasons.He looked the part Tuesday night as he excelled in more of a facilitator role due to Irving’s absence. That part of his game stood out to Brad Stevens.“I thought his offensive playmaking – passing the ball – was as good as his scoring,” Stevens said.All of this production was a reminder of the lofty thoughts attached to the Celtics before this season even began. The belief heading into this season was that they would own an embarrassment of riches when it came to depth. As the season has worn on, that belief has been born into existence, and they aren’t afraid to acknowledge it.“One of our great strengths as a team is depth,” Stevens said bluntly. “I mean, that’s just the way it is, and we’re lucky to have that depth.”Other teams aren’t so lucky to face it.Boston is now 7-2 when Rozier fills in for Irving in the starting lineup. It is 10-1 when Hayward scores 15 or more points. It is 22-9 since Dec. 6, when Jaylen Brown began to catch his rhythm and after which he has averaged 19.9 points per 36 minutes, which ranks second on the team.Other teams replace injured starters with reserves. As we saw Tuesday night, the Celtics replace injured starters with starters, and then they have even more starters available on the bench.That type of depth, folks, is utterly absurd.
BOSTON – There was a lot to digest from Thursday night’s dramatic finish at TD Garden, where the Los Angeles Lakers won a back-and-forth barnburner at the buzzer against the Boston Celtics.While it didn’t end the way Boston had hoped it would, the C’s still took some positives away from the matchup, such as the contributions it received from its second unit, particularly from Daniel Theis, who had one of the most impressive outings of his young career.Theis contributed to Boston’s 61-point bench effort with 20 points on a career-best 9-of-11 shooting from the field. The sophomore big man also corralled six rebounds – three on each end – dished out a pair of assists, tallied a pair of blocks and knocked down both of his 3-point attempts, all in just 23 minutes of play.  “Daniel was the game-changer,” said second-unit mate Terry Rozier, who tallied 19 points, six assists and four boards during Boston's 129-128 loss. “He played very well. We just fed off his energy on the defensive end blocking shots. Offensively he was playing with confidence, knocking down shots, tip-ins, so it was good to see him rolling like that.”Theis’ spark on the offensive end played a critical role in keeping Boston in the game during the Lakers’ 42-point third quarter. He scored 11 of Boston’s final 13 points of the frame over a span of less than four and a half minutes.The 6-foot-8 forward showed off a wide range of scoring skills during that short stretch, knocking down a mid-range jumper, a 3-pointer, a pair of dunks and a put-back layup.First, we’ll highlight the pick-and-pop mid-range shot that got Theis’ third-quarter scoring run started. He starts off the play by setting a pick on Kyle Kuzma above the left break, around which Gordon Hayward curls to receive a pass from Kyrie Irving. After Kuzma fights past the first screen, Theis turns around and sets another so that Hayward can curl back around the other way with the ball. Tyson Chandler then switches onto Hayward, and with Kuzma trailing the ball, Theis decides to pop out to the left elbow. Hayward sees him standing there wide open, delivers the pass, and the big man knocks it down.Theis extended his range even more on Boston’s next possession, as he canned a 3-pointer from just above the right break. Then, he switched things up a bit by putting on a dunking clinic.Theis’ first dunk starts off in a similar manner to the mid-range jumper, as he sets a screen on Kuzma near the top of the arc. This time, Kyrie Irving has the ball, and instead of popping, Theis rolls in between Kuzma and Tyson Chandler and straight to the basket. Irving acts quickly and dishes a lightning-fast bounce-pass to Theis, who soars in for an easy dunk. Less than two minutes later, Theis’ hands meet the rim again, this time in the form of an alley-oop jam off of a dime from Hayward.Theis then finished off the frame in gritty fashion by rising up in between two Lakers defenders for a put-back tip-in off of a Jaylen Brown miss.While he made most of his impact during the third-quarter, Theis' two most highlight-worthy plays came during the final frame. The first play was yet another dunk – his third of the game.While his Celtics are orchestrating transition offense, Theis jogs up the court alongside JaVale McGee. Theis lags behind and stops short at the 3-point arc, losing McGee, who continues loping into the paint. Ball handler Terry Rozier feeds the wide-open Theis at the top of the arc, who then allows McGee to retrace his steps in the form of an aggressive close-out, before cutting toward the basket and taking flight from the middle of the paint for a ferocious dunk.Theis’ second noteworthy fourth-quarter highlight came on the defensive end, where he delivered the most emphatic block of the night.On this possession, Theis positions himself right under the basket, ready to take on any Laker that comes his way. The first opponent he deals with his Brandon Ingram, who curls around a screen into the paint, where he receives a pass from LeBron James. Though, just as Ingram catches the ball, Theis drapes his arms all over him, so the Lakers forward is forced to kick the ball out to Rajon Rondo in the left corner. Rondo, who is wide open beyond the arc, waits for Rozier to close out, before taking off toward the basket for what is primed to be an uncontested lay-up. However, Theis is able to fight around a wide screen set by McGee just in time to meet Rondo at the rim, where he swats the ball all the way over to the sideline.Six minutes later, Rondo captured the spotlight by knocking down a game-winning, second-chance jumper at the buzzer, though Theis’ career performance shouldn’t go unrecognized in the midst of all the drama that unfurled at TD Garden.
PHILADELPHIA – “Adversity hits, we respond.”That’s what Celtics big man Al Horford tweeted Tuesday night following a thrilling, 112-109 bounce-back win in Philadelphia. The adversity was in reference to a pair of frustrating losses the Celtics had just suffered at home. Last Thursday, they coughed up an 18-point lead to the Los Angeles Lakers, and two nights later, they let a 28-point advantage slip from their grasp against the Clippers.The team was understandably discouraged following both losses, and particularly after the second defeat. However, the C’s came into Philly with their heads held high Tuesday night, having the utmost confidence that they’d be able to take down one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference on its home court, even without leading scorer Kyrie Irving (strained right knee) on the floor to help guide them.From the get-go, there was a positive aura in the way that Boston was playing. The C’s had attitude, tenacity and took a fearless approach against a 76ers team that was riding high after putting up a season-high 143 points on the Lakers Sunday night.“Coming into this game we understood, Philly’s been playing at a high level,” Horford said of the Sixers, who last week added a high-volume scorer in Tobias Harris to their roster. “We had some disappointing losses at home, and I felt our backs were against the wall. We all needed to come out and set the tone, and we did that.”The Celtics had also set the tone against the Lakers and Clippers last week, but were unable to maintain their authority over either team. This game, on the other hand, had a totally different feel to it.“I just thought the whole night we played the right way and we just tried to stay within ourselves and we didn’t get too high or too low,” C’s coach Brad Stevens said. “We fought and that’s what you have to do to have a chance to win.”“What I’m most proud of in our group is that we were able to sustain it,” Horford added. “We just played hard. Even if we would have lost, I was just happy our guys were really engaged through the game.”Horford was one of the most engaged players throughout the night. He tallied 23 points, eight rebounds, five assists and four steals, all while matching up against one of the best big men in the league in Joel Embiid.“He's super important to our team, obviously, to be the best that we can be,” C’s coach Brad Stevens said of his veteran big man. “I just think what he does for us is unique and certainly, against these guys, he's critical. He can stretch the floor on one end, and he can battle on the other.”Also producing at an elite level was Gordon Hayward, who logged a game-high 26 points off the bench while tying a career-high with six 3-point makes on seven attempts. The last of those makes was the go-ahead bucket with 1:50 left in the game, which helped the C’s reverse momentum after a 7-0 Sixers run.Though, it wasn’t just those two guys contributing. This was a well-rounded effort by the C’s, who also got a 20-point, 10 rebound performance out of Jayson Tatum and a 17-point, eight-rebound effort out of Marcus Morris.And the best part was that no one let up at any point throughout the 48-minute journey. It was the perfect solution to put last week’s discouragement in the rearview mirror.“This was one of the better games,” said Morris, a Philadelphia native. “Not even that we won, man. It’s the intensity everybody played with, the force everybody played with, and we just let it go. Everybody played. And it was very fun.”More importantly, the bounce-back win served as a lesson to the team. And it’s a lesson that Stevens hopes carries over into Wednesday night’s game against the Detroit Pistons before heading into the All-Star break.“Good teams have clunkers, but good teams respond to those with the right effort and approach,” the coach explained. "That was a good one and now we’ve got another tough one tomorrow night and we’ll see if we can play well again. We’re going to have to play with the same kind of purpose.”
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – If you want to judge the Boston Celtics by their first half of preseason play, they’re gonna be really, really good.If you want to judge them by their second half of preseason play, they’ve got a lot to work on.Such is the preseason.The Celtics dominated Charlotte through Friday’s first half while their top players ate up all of the playing time. The second half was far more competitive, as Boston’s most inexperienced players were forced into a battle that they lost, 104-97, on the campus of the University of North Carolina.Boston, with its starting lineup of Kyrie Irving, Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Jayson Tatum and Al Horford whole again for the first time since last year’s Opening Night, overwhelmed the Hornets from the opening tip with its deep pool of talent. Seven players scored at least six points during first half, led by Jaylen Brown’s 12. The Celtics also nailed eight 3-pointers – and they felt as if they should have connected on even more.“I don’t think we shot the ball well as a team,” said Gordon Hayward, who logged 23 minutes of playing time during his first game action since Oct. 17 of last year. “But we got some really good looks.”Charlotte’s offense, meanwhile, did not, as it managed to shoot only 35.6 percent from the field during the first half while the lengthy and agile Celtics hassled them.The first half featured the type of performance many expect to see regularly from Boston this season. The offense was ultra-aggressive and all of the talent came together as a unit at both ends. The Celtics led by as many as 20 points during the second quarter and owned a 60-45 lead at the break.“We were playing fast as hell,” said Terry Rozier, who scored 11 points on the night. “We were going out there and having fun.”The second half was not quite as enjoyable for Boston. The rhythm it showcased during the first half disappeared and seemed to transfer directly over to the Hornets. Charlotte began to move the ball and create open shots, and it capitalized on them by scoring 39 points during the third quarter alone – just six fewer than it scored during the entire first half.Granted, this all happened as the Celtics began tinkering with their lineups and resting their top players, but still, Brad Stevens still saw many of his rotational players lacking the effort that’s necessary for the team to become great.“We’ve got to play lower in a stance because we were fouling all over the place,” Stevens said, alluding to the 24 personal fouls Boston was whistled for during the second half. “We knew that that was an emphasis coming in.“Everybody has talked about that, that you’re not going to be able to wrap guys. You’re not going to be able to hold guys. To play better, you have to play lower and you have to play in a stance. So we have a long way to go to rebuild that.”Rozier, who was on the court for seven minutes of that third quarter, agreed, He witnessed Charlotte’s collective confidence to grow in front of his very eyes, and once that happens in the NBA, a double-digit lead can disappear in an instant.“We didn’t stick to our defensive tendencies and what we practice, and we let them get comfortable and they started hitting shots and they just took off from there,” he said. “We let our foot off the gas, and a lot of credit goes to them.”Boston may have been braking during the second half, but the C’s also gave a glimpse of what they’re capable of when their collective pedal is pushed to the metal. They can dominate opponents with their skill, their athleticism, and their defensive abilities, but they are the first to acknowledge that they have a long way to go in that regard.“I’m not going to give a letter grade,” Brown said of Boston’s performance, “but I’m just going to say we can do a lot better. We can do a lot better.”That’s what the preseason is all about. There will be a fair share of good, and there will be a fair share of bad. Boston had both Friday night, and it will look to have more of the latter when it returns to the court Sunday night to host the Hornets at TD Garden.
The Boston Celtics had just fallen to 1-2 in the preseason and had just struggled defensively for the third time in as many games. It was time to let his feelings be known - publicly.Following a 102-95 defeat Tuesday night at the hands of the Cleveland Cavaliers, he began by saying, “I think overall in the first week, [our main rotation] has not been effective.”He continued, adding, “I thought we looked like a sieve defensively.”And then came the knockout punch: “I couldn’t me more unimpressed after our first three exhibition games.”Here’s why:The Celtics have now given up an average of 106.0 points per game during the preseason. They’ve allowed opponents to outshoot them by nearly 9.0 percent from the field. They’ve committed a total of 92 personal fouls, good for an average of 30.7 per game.Those numbers are in stark contrast to last season, when Boston allowed opponents to score only 100.4 PPG on 44.0 percent shooting, all while committing an average of just 19.7 fouls per game.Strangely, this is the same team that dominated opponents with its defense a season ago, yet currently, it doesn’t look like the same team at all.“We’ve just got to get back to being us,” said Marcus Smart, who is well-known for his defensive talents. “We’re doing things we usually don’t do on the defensive end. We were being lazy, guys are switching onto guys instead of guarding on a guy, and we were wanting somebody else to do the job for us, and that’s not us.”Truly, it isn’t. It’s not even the preseason Celtics from a season ago.Last preseason, the Celtics allowed only 95.0 PPG and never committed more than 24 personal fouls in a game. They never allowed more than 102 points in a game, and they averaged only 21.3 fouls per game over four contests.Those facts eliminate the argument that the C’s are simply shaking off the standard preseason rust after a summer off. The fact of this matter is that the Celtics just aren’t in the same place defensively as they were a year ago after their first three preseason games.Hiding below that information, however, is another important note: that this year’s preseason has been flipped. The Celtics are seven days into their training camp, and they’ve already played three preseason games. Last preseason, the Celtics didn’t play their first exhibition contest until the sixth day of training camp.Boston will play its final preseason game Saturday night in Cleveland. After that contest, the team will essentially have the opportunity to hold a true training camp, as it will have nine full days to figure it all out prior to Opening Night, which arrives Oct. 16.A shot at true and lengthy training camp, in Boston’s mind, is the Ace up its collective sleeve. The Celtics believe that, with ample time, they will right their defensive ship and sail full-speed ahead into Opening Night.“It gives us extra time,” Smart said of the gap between Boston’s final preseason game and Opening Night. “We can tune up things and we can hone in on things that Brad and the coaching staff emphasize to us.”Stevens’ assessment Tuesday night of his team’s defensive play was fair, to say the least. His players even admitted as much in the locker room.But they didn’t walk away from reporters before highlighting the fact that they still have plenty of time to rectify their issues before games actually count. “We’re not worried,” said Smart. “We’re obviously disappointed, but at the same time, this is why we have preseason, to get back in the groove and get chemistry with the guys and get back to doing what we do.”They’d better do so soon, because their coach isn’t pleased with that he’s seen thus far.
BOSTON – Maybe a 1-2 start, saddled by lackadaisical defense, isn’t as bad for the Boston Celtics as many seem to believe.Maybe, in the end, it’ll be blessing.That’s what Brad Stevens insinuated Thursday night, ahead of the team’s Fan Fest at TD Garden.“Being uncomfortable is a good thing,” he said with a grin. “There’s nothing wrong with that. Competition is hard.”Boston, which is stacked with talent and presumed to be the top team in the East, has learned that quickly.The Celtics are 1-2 in the preseason and have given up an average of 106.0 points per game. Those results prompted Stevens to say Tuesday night that his team’s defense looked like “a sieve,” and to add that he “couldn’t be more unimpressed after our first three exhibition games.”If Stevens was that upset, it’s nearly a guarantee that the players were in a similar state of mind. All of them had an off day on Wednesday to let it marinate, and that prompted them all to return to the practice court Thursday afternoon with a heightened level of enthusiasm and concentration.“The first couple of days, we just were hesitant with the moves and the cuts that we were making on the floor,” said Al Horford, who noted that the team has still only been together for a total of nine days. “For example, today at practice, it was great. The energy was great, the ball movement (was great), guys were getting comfortable with the reads, what to expect, what to do. So today it looked like we finally started to get it.”Marcus Smart concurred.“Everybody was locked in today,” he said. “Everybody was ready to go. It felt good to play like that, the way we can play.”Sure, everyone would have loved for such to have been the case from Day 1, but not everything in life comes easy. Sometimes it takes work. Sometimes it takes overcoming challenges. Sometimes it takes, as Stevens suggested, feeling uncomfortable.All of those things can lead to the change in mindset the C’s are now experiencing.“It builds your character,” Smart said of feeling a bit uncomfortable as a team. “It builds you as a player, as an individual, having that adversity, it being tough. You have to figure it out.”The Celtics are in the process of doing so. Just remember, it is a process, and sometimes, it’s a good thing to feel a little bit uncomfortable as it all unfolds.
CLEVELAND – The Boston Celtics have shown tremendous passion on the practice court this fall, according to coach Brad Stevens, but for unbeknownst reasons, the team’s tenacity has yet to carry over into any of its games.Saturday night’s preseason finale against the Cleveland Cavaliers was the latest episode of frustration for the C’s, as their record dropped to 1-3 with a 113-102 loss at Quicken Loans Arena.“I just want to play with spirit, passion and togetherness,” Stevens said following the game. “We just have to find that kind of joy in playing together. The last couple of nights, for whatever reason, have not looked like practice. They looked like we were just kind of waltzing through the motions. We’ve got to be better than that.”The C’s have no more exhibition games on their schedule, so they’ll have to make all of their adjustments back in the practice gym. Boston will have 10 days to prepare until the regular season tips off, and the team will have its hands full during that span.“We have a lot of work ahead. That’s just the reality of it,” Al Horford sternly stated before boarding the team bus out of The Q. “There’s no excuses. We have a lot of work to do.”The first order of business will be a collective attitude check. Terry Rozier senses that the team, generally speaking, was overconfident entering the preseason. He hopes that the recent stretch of mediocre play will help bring everybody back down to Earth.“I feel like we need to get our mind right. Take some time off,” said Rozier, who tied for a team-high 17 points against the Cavs. “But at the same time, we gotta get out there and just find our way. “I feel like we arrived like we already won something,” the fourth-year point guard continued. “Teams know that people are talking about us every time you turn on the TV, so that’s going to motivate them to want to beat us no matter if it’s the second string, third string, no matter who it is. We’ve got to stay grounded and go back to playing Boston Celtics basketball and being who we are instead of thinking we’re above everybody.”One thing that the C’s had against them entering preseason play was having a lack of time to prepare. They only had two days of training camp before their first game, while some teams had as many as 10 days from the start of training camp until their first contest.Boston, however, will not let that be an excuse for how they played.“It’s different,” Horford said of the schedule, “but one of the things that Coach always talks about is being able to deal with adversity. Things are just different sometimes, and that happens to be the schedule and we have to go through it.”The one advantage of having a top-heavy schedule is that the C’s will now have a week and a half to bond behind closed doors and figure out all of their issues before Opening Night.“This week has to be completely focused on team, completely focused on we, and that’s what we’re going to get to,” said Stevens. “There can’t be any more feeling out. There are no more games to feel out. So, we’ll see. We’ll see if we’re good enough 10 days from now, and then it will start.” 

BOSTON – When Jared Sullinger told the world on media day that he would get his “big butt on the block” this season, we all thought he’d do so to score.Turns out, his low post game benefits the Celtics in more ways than one.Sullinger has showcased high-level passing skills during the preseason while operating on the block.  Most recently, he dished out three assists during just 13-plus minutes of action as Boston downed Brooklyn 111-105 Monday night.“He’s a really good passer,” Brad Stevens said after the game of Sullinger’s dishes.  “He sees the floor.  He’s really smart.  He knows how to play.”The 23-year-old big man has been refining those skills since he was a young boy, playing under the tutelage of his father and coach, Satch Sullinger.  The elder Sullinger taught his son how to read and react like a guard.“My dad played me at point guard in high school a couple of times,” the power forward said Monday night.  “My passing ability is there.”And we all saw it against Brooklyn.Sullinger’s first assist came off of a dribble hand-off, which no one would quantify as an advanced play.  His final two dishes, however, came off of beautiful – and difficult – reads from the post.First, with 2:27 left in the first quarter, Sullinger found Avery Bradley on the left wing for an open 3-pointer.  The play was quite impressive to watch from start to finish.Brad Stevens saw a matchup that he liked, with Chris Daniels defending Sullinger down low, and demanded that the ball be passed to Sullinger on the right block.  The fourth-year power forward caught the entry pass from Avery Bradley, let the guard cut through to the other side of the court, and then went to work.Dahntay Jones immediately swarmed down from the top of the key to double-team Sullinger, but it yielded no results for Brooklyn.  Sully spun away from the double and toward the baseline, and then back over his right shoulder and toward the paint.As he finished that second spin, Sullinger split his two defenders and immediately located Bradley behind the 3-point arc on the opposite wing.  Sullinger quickly hit his open teammate with a pinpoint pass, and Bradley canned the trey.Making quality reads and passes from the post is challenging, and doing so becomes even more difficult while facing a double-team.  Sullinger, however, is not fazed by a defense’s blitz.“I’ve been going against a double-team all my life.  I’m used to it,” he said.  “I just know where to go, and I know the reads, and I trust my teammates to be in their spots.”That’s exactly what happened, as Sullinger described, during the play with Bradley.“I felt the double and I was looking for the next open person,” he said.  “It happened to be Avery [on the wing].  So it was just me trying to have some hang time – which I don’t – and try to find the open player.”His next pass was just as impressive, and maybe even quicker.Sullinger, again operating against Daniels from the right block, took an entry pass from Marcus Smart.  Smart cleared through as Bradley had before and Sullinger faced up from about 17 feet out.Less than a second after he faced up, Kelly Olynyk flashed toward the basket from the opposite wing, beating every Brooklyn defender to the sweet spot of the defense.  Sullinger whipped a two-handed pass over his Daniels’ head and into Olynyk’s hands for an easy layup.  The play drew a strong ovation from the Celtics bench.Three assists in less than three minutes of action.  Sullinger looked like a point forward on the court.The box score logged each of Sullinger’s dishes as only one assist, but they count as so much more than that.  They stand as proof that he is much more than a scorer in the post.  He can also read and react to a defense and feed his teammates for quality looks, just like those smaller guys are known to do on the perimeter.
BOSTON – Rediscovering his confidence is half of the battle that Gordon Hayward faces as he continues his journey back from the leg injury that sidelined him for all of last season. He appeared to take a huge step forward in that department Friday night, as he displayed a level of offensive authority against the Cleveland Cavaliers that he hadn’t shown in quite a long time.Hayward contributed 14 points toward the Celtics’ 128-95 win at TD Garden, and while it wasn’t his highest-scoring effort, it was certainly his most tenacious. The veteran wing was driving to the rim without hesitation, showing glimpses of his former self all through the night, as he helped guide the Celtics to their most lopsided win in more than three years.What prompted the change in Hayward’s play was a spike in confidence, and the process of boosting that morale was a joint effort.Hayward was approached by Kyrie Irving during practice Wednesday afternoon and received some constructive advice and encouragement. “Looks for your shot more,” Irving told him. “Get aggressive and get yourself going because you are a great talent in this league and I don’t want you to forget that.”Irving then relayed this message to the media the following afternoon, while also making a prediction about Hayward's play: “I think coming up in the next few games, he’ll be able to show some different things… just being more aggressive offensively and looking for his shot more.”Sure enough, that’s exactly what happened the very next night inside TD Garden.“And look at how much we won by,” Irving pointed out with an all-knowing shrug.Hayward finished 6-of-9 from the field, including a 3-of-4 effort off of drives alone. Entering the game, he had averaged only 1.5 driving field goal attempts per game on a 41.4 percent shooting clip, so this was a giant step in the right direction.Hayward’s aggressiveness also opened up opportunities for others around him, as he was able to drive and kick to his teammates throughout the night. He finished with four assists, while also garnering a plus-16 rating during 24 minutes of action.The tone of Hayward's effort reflected that he had taken Irving’s advice to heart.“Anytime you hear it from another teammate, especially a guy like Kyrie, it instills some confidence within you,” he said. Watching that confidence emerge was something that Irving and the rest of the Celtics thoroughly enjoyed.“I think that that right there was a happy moment, an exciting moment for all of us, because it was all in the flow of our offense,” said Irving, who dropped 29 points of his own Friday night. “It was all Gordon being Gordon, getting to the spots where he wanted to and being the player that he’s been over the course of his career as he’s improved over time. It’s our job to exude confidence in him, but it’s also his responsibility to bring that confidence within himself every night.”Hayward says that it’s a lot easier to bring that confidence when his shot is falling consistently, and such has been the case of late. During his first 16 games, he shot just 38.9 percent from the field, but over his last four contests, his clip has skyrocketed to 51.4 percent.“Sometimes it’s hard to be aggressive in looking for your shot if shots aren’t going in,” Hayward admitted. “I think the only way, though, is that you’ve got to keep shooting, you’ve got to keep attacking. I talked [Thursday] about getting to the free-throw line more – I did it one time tonight, so that’s a start – but I think just having more of an attacking mentality helped me out.”It sure helped the Celtics out as well Friday night, as Hayward’s aggressiveness helped lead the team to its greatest offensive effort of the campaign.
MINNEAPOLIS – We’ve reached the point where Gordon Hayward is no longer just “getting better.” He’s now taking over and winning games for the Boston Celtics.Just as they signed him to do.Hayward’s season-best performance Saturday night in Minnesota was the latest installment in a series of efforts that have showcased his continued progression. He may not be back to 100 percent from his gruesome ankle injury, but he’s getting darn close.Hayward piled up a game-high and season-high 30 points against Minnesota while tying or setting new season highs in both rebounds (nine) and assists (eight). He scored 16 points during the fourth quarter alone to stymie a comeback attempt by the Timberwolves and to help Boston close out a 118-109 victory.“It was a great team win for us,” Hayward said after the game, “and as involved as I was, it felt really good.”So, too, did the Gatorade shower he rightfully received from his teammates during his walk-off TV interview as they all celebrated the crowning moment of Hayward's comeback.On the second night of a back-to-back, no less, Hayward became the first reserve in Celtics history to total at least 30 points, at least nine rebounds and at least eight assists in a single game. The performance prompted Kyrie Irving to make a strong statement in the postgame locker room: “Gordon is being Gordon now.”In other words, he’s back, and that shouldn’t surprise anyone, seeing as clues to this rebirth have been piling up over the last week and a half. Hayward scored what was a season-best of 19 points Nov. 21 against New York. He has now rattled off four double-digit scoring efforts in his last five appearances, averaging 15.8 points per game on 47.1 percent shooting during that span.That’s the quantitative evidence that was building up in front of everyone’s eyes, but there was plenty of qualitative evidence as well.First, there were Irving’s comments following Thursday’s practice.“I think that coming out into the next few games,” he warned, “he’ll be able to show some different things than he has been [since] the start of the season.”Then, there were Brad Stevens’ comments after Hayward scored 14 points during Friday’s win over Cleveland.“He did have a really good week of practice,” Stevens revealed. “You could kind of see that there was gonna be some good days ahead here.”Those days have arrived, thanks to a drastic change in Hayward’s approach.Hayward had been drawing the ire of onlookers early in the season due to his passiveness and hesitancy with the ball. He wasn’t looking to score or to put the pressure on defenses. He lacked the confidence to do so.Hayward told Celtics.com Saturday night that he made a conscious decision to erase those trends as he headed into Wednesday’s practice. “I think just trying to change my mindset,” he said. “Just being aggressive. Being an attacker. That’s really all I can say about where it came from.”Wherever it came from, it worked. Hayward’s aggressiveness led to him attempting a game-high 10 free throws against the Timberwolves, and he converted on all of them. To put that number into perspective, the Celtics entered Saturday night averaging 19.1 free throw attempts per game as a team this season.Following Hayward’s final two freebies, which iced Boston’s win with 1:23 left on the clock, Hayward turned around to find Irving waking his way from the other end of the court. Irving’s head was shaking, his eyes were wide, and his lips were chirping. Irving said he told Hayward, “Way to take over the game and make shots.”Irving nailed it. Hayward is no longer just getting better and working his way back. He’s now taking over games and leading Boston to momentous victories on the road.
DETROIT – Winning masks deficiencies. The Boston Celtics had been masking a couple of theirs for two straight weeks.Not many noticed Boston’s defensive slippage as it carried an eight-game win streak into Saturday night’s matchup with the Pistons in Detroit. That slippage was impossible to ignore, however, after the Celtics fell 113-104.Defensive breakdowns have now surfaced for four straight games, although the C’s are 3-1 during those contests. Among those breakdowns are two that stand above the rest: the inability to stop opposing offenses during first halves, and a regression in defending the 3-point line.Saturday night, Detroit became the fourth consecutive Celtics opponent to score at least 53 points during the first half on at least 45.2 percent shooting. Overall during the four games, Boston’s opponents averaged 55.3 points on a combined 47.6 percent shooting during first halves. The Pistons tallied 57 first-half points on 52.4 percent shooting.Equally troubling is the fact that Boston’s 3-point defense, which ranks in the top five in the league, has taken a step backward. The Celtics entered Saturday night ranked fourth in the NBA in opponent 3-point percentage with a mark of 32.5 percent. However, including Detroit’s 10-for-30 performance Saturday, Boston’s last four opponents have combined to make 46 3-pointers on 36.2 percent shooting.Boston’s powerful offense was the main reason why these deficiencies were hiding under the surface. The C’s had caught fire over the last two weeks, surging to the top of the league in many offensive categories during that span. Brad Stevens stated Saturday that the offensive firepower may have begun to affect the defense.“I think generally when you go through a run like we just went on and you’re scoring the way [we] scored, there’s a natural tendency to slip a little defensively,” he said.Marcus Smart told Celtics.com that such was a topic of discussion amongst the team following its loss to Detroit.“That’s actually what we talked about: we’ve been scoring at an incredible rate, but our defense has been dropping,” Smart said. “So we’ve just got to balance those two out. Once we do that, we’ll get back to the team we can be and the team that we want to be.”Smart indicated that doing so will begin with high-level preparation.“Everything that we’re doing out there at the defensive end can be fixed,” he said. “You’ve just got to go look at the film, learn from it, get with your coaches, and just listen to the game plan that Brad has.”Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving commented that Boston’s defense overall has been strong, but brief lapses have been holding it back from being dominant. He agreed with Stevens’ claim that the offense has affected the defense, and said the C’s are allowing opponents to score too many “easy points.” “I think that what Coach Stevens means of the drop-off (is) when we score that many points and then we just allow other teams to get those easy points where it’s like, they throw the ball out in transition and get an easy layup, or they get a back-door cut, something that’s easy,” Irving explained.Along those lines, for example, Detroit scored 17 points off of Celtics turnovers during the first half Saturday night, and 26 overall in the game. Transition offense keyed the Pistons’ game-changing, 13-0 run during the second half.These breakdowns have shown the Celtics that although they rattled off eight straight wins, they still have plenty of room to improve.When asked Saturday night where he thinks Boston’s defense stands right now, Irving replied, “I think we’re solid.” Solid is good, but the Celtics don’t want to be good; they want to be great. In order to reach that level, they’ve got some work to do at the defensive end of the floor.
BOSTON – Jaylen Brown had one objective in mind Thursday night as he returned to action following a three-game injury absence: “Be aggressive.” So, as soon as he checked into Boston’s matchup against the New York Knicks at TD Garden, the third-year wing was sure to make his presence felt. Within a minute of subbing in late in the first quarter, Brown received a pass in the left corner, barreled along the baseline against 6-foot-11 Knicks center Enes Kanter, drew contact and banked home in an over-the-shoulder lay-up, all before calmly walking to the free-throw line to complete the 3-point play.This was only a taste of what Brown would bring to the table to help his Celtics cruise to a 128-100 win over their Atlantic Division rival.Fully healed from a lower back injury that he suffered Nov. 24 in Dallas, Brown returned to form with ease, delivering a season-high 21-point effort, while shooting 7-of-10 from the field. All seven of those buckets came from inside the paint, and he added seven more from the free-throw line to tie his career-high.Brown accomplished all of this while adjusting to a new role. He came off the bench for the first time in the regular season since his rookie campaign in 2016-17. But that change didn’t throw him off one bit.“I thought he was really good,” coach Brad Stevens commented after the game. “I thought he played with great pace and purpose and made really good decisions. I didn’t think anything was forced, which sometimes, when you come off the bench, that’s one of the things you try to catch up to the game quickly.  He just played the right way and (the way) we needed.”What they needed from Brown was for him to drive to the basket at will, which he did time and time again Thursday night. “I just think that that’s when he’s at his best,” said Al Horford, who had one of his best games of the season with a 19-point, 12-rebound, four-block effort. “When he’s able to read the floor, attack the right way, there’s not a lot of guys who can stay in front of him.”That was New York’s main issue during the fourth quarter, when Brown helped to put the game out of reach. The Knicks hung within 10 points for the majority of the game, but Brown finally gave the C’s some separation during the final frame, as he poured in eight points during the last 10 minutes of regulation.“Just gotta keep hitting that stone – keep hitting that stone and it’s gonna split in half,” Brown said of his relentless approach in putting the Knicks away.Brown’s tenacity remained the same as always, even while playing a role that he's not used to. He anticipated Wednesday afternoon that he would be coming off the bench upon his return, but that didn’t matter to him in the least. as long as he would still be able to do his part in helping the team win.“It’s no different for me,” Brown said of coming off the bench as opposed to starting. “Basketball is basketball whether it’s coming off the bench or walking out of the stands. It’s all basketball so I just come out and play.”And there’s one objective when he comes out to play.“I’m going to do what I do best: be aggressive.”
BOSTON – They’re highly-skilled. They’re selfless. And most of all, they’re as tough as nails.They are: Bench With Attitude.Veteran forward Marcus Morris coined the BWA nickname Monday at Celtics Media Day in reference to himself and his fellow bold, Boston benchmen. During the short period of time between then and now, the moniker has spread like wildfire across Celtics Nation. “They’re selling T-shirts, man. I need a couple dollars off that,” Morris quipped with a smile while addressing reporters Wednesday evening after completing Day 2 of training camp.With all jokes aside, the Celtics' second unit could be downright scary this season, should the team go with the same starting five as it did on Opening Night last year. As for the nickname that Morris conceived, it perfectly suits what fans should expect out of Boston’s reserves all season long. With seasoned vets like Morris and Aron Baynes, scrappy guards like Terry Rozier and Marcus Smart, striving youngsters like Semi Ojeleye, Daniel Theis and Guerschon Yabusele, and promising rookies like Brad Wanamaker and Robert Williams, the Celtics bench unit has all the makings of being a force to be reckoned with.“We definitely got a lot of guys that can start in this league,” said Morris. “And for opposing teams, if they’re not ready, it could get real ugly. And that’s the approach we’re taking – when we get out there, we’re going to try to separate ourselves every time.”In order to create separation, a team must have a proper balance of offensive firepower and defensive toughness. This Celtics’ second unit has both.Three of the aforementioned players – Morris, Rozier and Smart – averaged double figures in scoring last season, so they should all be able to help maintain or spark the offense whenever they enter a game.As for the defensive side of things, that’s where this group should shine the brightest. In the middle, there could potentially be the fearless Baynes, who started 67 games last season at center and earned the top individual defensive rating in the NBA among all players who played at least half of the season. Joining Baynes in the frontcourt could be Morris – one of the toughest, most versatile defenders around, and Theis – a rising sophomore who can block shots and battle on the boards.And then, there’s the backcourt bulldogs – Rozier and Smart – two tenacious guards who will put their bodies on the line night-in and night-out for the betterment of the team.“I think we probably have the toughest team, the toughest bench, the toughest coach,” said Smart. “I definitely got a lot of attitude. I know Morris got a lot of attitude. And I know other guys on this team got a lot of attitude. So, I’m rockin’ with (BWA).”Now, just imagine having to face BWA after dealing with a potential starting lineup of Jaylen Brown, Gordon Hayward, Al Horford, Kyrie Irving and Jayson Tatum. The talent is spread so evenly across the board, from starters to reserves, that it’s almost like facing a starting 10.“Once our second unit comes in, I don’t care who they’ve got on their team, there’s no second unit that’s better than ours,” claimed Morris.To have such talent within a second unit, players must be willing to make sacrifices. Like Morris mentioned earlier, many of these guys are skilled enough to be NBA starters – and many of them have been in the past.With that being said, they’ve all expressed willingness to come off the bench as long as it raises the chances of them reaching their ultimate goal of a championship. “For a team to be great, you’ve gotta make sacrifices,” said Smart. “You’ve gotta put your egos aside, because we’re trying to play for something greater than ourselves. So, when you’ve got a group of guys that come together and connect on this level, things go easier for us. It’s not that hard. Everybody here just wants to play and help our team, so starting or not, it doesn’t matter.”What does matter is that each player does his part to help push the Celtics farther down the path toward Banner 18. Boston’s bench plans to play a major role in accomplishing that feat – and they will do so with attitude.
BOSTON – Ask any member of the Boston Celtics about their sparkling new Auerbach Center at New Balance World Headquarters and they get a twinkle in their eye.The building is as beautiful as any basketball facility in the world, but it wasn’t built for its aesthetics; it was built for functionality, and the Celtics are capitalizing on it.The organization went all-in on its new practice facility with the goal of building an environment that would assist in the development and recovery of its players and staff. Through its first two days of official practice, it sounds as if the Auerbach Center is delivering on its lofty goals.“This is a great facility. It’s awesome,” said Marcus Smart, who spent his first four NBA seasons practicing in Boston’s dated facility in Waltham, Massachusetts. “This organization did a great job of making sure we had whatever we needed made available for us and the staff. We’re blessed to have this and we’re excited.”It certainly seemed that way following Tuesday’s first day of practice, after which veteran Al Horford sent out an Instagram photo of himself and four teammates soaking in their new cold tub. The cold tub is one of many new toys that the players have at their disposal to assist in their recovery from practices and games.Smart recently opted to utilize one option which he had never even seen before, let alone used before.“So we have, like, a float tank,” he said, referencing the dark, chamber-like tub room that features nearly a half-ton of salt in its tub of water. “I have (used it), and it’s very relaxing and it’s good on your body.”But the list doesn’t end there.“The cold tub, the hot tub, the pool, and things like that,” Smart added as he rattled off more of the available recovery tools. “We’ve got different things to really help our bodies, and in this league you need that with as much as we play.”The players love that aspect, while Brad Stevens is loving the upgrade to his practice canvas. In Waltham, the coach had only one basketball court at his disposal, a court which was flanked by five hoops that offered little-to-no room between them. Now he and the Celtics have two full-size courts that are flanked by six well-spaced hoops.Stevens gave a few examples Wednesday of how the court upgrades will help the team practice.“You don’t feel like your voices are on top of each other quite as much,” he said. “We can break into three groups, four groups if we want. The pre-practice shooting doesn’t start an hour and 40 minutes before (practice); it starts 60 minutes before, because we have more courts to work on.”The only negative to the facility, joked Smart, is that he doesn’t know how to get out of it.“It’s confusing, I’m not gonna lie,” he said with a laugh. “I’ve heard of keeping someone out, but keeping someone in is different. You’ve got to have a key to get out of here.”With the way this place was built, though, why would he or anyone want to leave?The Auerbach Center serves its players customized food throughout the day, it has all of the recovery options the players could possibly need, it has nap rooms, it has entertainment rooms,  and it has plenty of space for individual workouts.It’s no wonder why the Celtics’ eyes twinkle every time they speak about the facility. This building has everything they need, and everything they didn’t have as recently as five months ago.
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – A Butler University reunion near the campus of the University of North Carolina? Well, that was unexpected.So says Ron Nored, who enjoyed the reunion dinner Thursday night in Chapel, Hill, North Carolina.Nored is one of seven former Bulldogs, along with Celtics head coach Brad Stevens, who happened to be in Chapel Hill for Friday’s preseason matchup between the Celtics and the Hornets at UNC’s Dean Smith Center. The game created the perfect opportunity for many of Butler’s most famous alumni to break bread in the most unlikely of places.Six members of the teams that reached the 2010 and 2011 national championship games, and one more who overlapped with many of them, linked up for dinner to share smiles and stories. Stevens and Nored, who is now an assistant coach for the Hornets, were two of the seven. The rest of the crew was made up by former Butler assistant coach and current Celtics assistant coach Micah Shrewsberry, former Butler point guard and current Celtics/Red Claws coach Alex Barlow, Celtics star forward Gordon Hayward, and two other guards from the famous Bulldogs teams, Grant Leiendecker and Alex Anglin, each of whom live in the Raleigh-Durham area.Nored did his best to explain how weird, yet fun, it was to get the crew back together.“I did not (expect this to happen at UNC), and it’s pretty weird being on the other sideline from these guys,” he said. “But it’s cool that we got to be together and hang out and share some old stories.”Those stories? They could write a book.Nored recalled one passage that took place following an early-season game in 2009, the same season that ended with Butler’s first NCAA championship game.“One of the stories that came out [Thursday] night at dinner was that Gordon remembered we lost to Georgetown at Madison Square Garden our sophomore year, got embarrassed,” Nored said with a smile. “After the game, I had like a 20-minute tirade to our team. The game got brought up [Thursday] and Gordon was like, ‘Bro, you went off on us for 20 minutes.’ And Brad was outside the locker room – the coaches stayed outside, they didn’t come in.“And apparently (Jim) Harbaugh – Harbaugh was with (Tom) Crean because IU played next (and Crean and Harbaugh are in-laws) – and Harbaugh was like, ‘Man, that young coach (Stevens) is getting after these guys.’ And Brad was like, ‘No, I’m right here. That’s one of our players.’”Amid some chuckles, Nored said the crew dropped a few other secretive stories on their former coaches during the dinner.“Some of the good ones were when we told Brad about things we did while we were in college that he didn’t know about,” he said, grinning. “I think he was probably not that shocked about it.”Nored and Hayward were two key cogs in the group’s first trip to the title game. They also happened to be roommates on the road for their first two collegiate seasons. After their sophomore season, their careers darted in very different directions.Hayward declared for the 2010 NBA Draft and was chosen ninth overall by the Utah Jazz. He went on to become an All-Star in Utah before joining Boston during the summer of 2017.Nored, meanwhile, began to feel a gravitation toward coaching.Beginning with his junior year, Nored recalls, Stevens and Shrewsberry began grooming him to eventually join the coaching ranks. And just two short years later, in 2013, Stevens hired Nored to coach with the Celtics and the Maine Red Claws. Nored quickly rose up the coaching ranks and in May landed a position on James Borrego’s staff in Charlotte.Prior to coaching against his mentor Friday night as a member of the Hornets, Nored couldn’t stop himself from gushing about what Stevens taught him along the way.“I learned more from that guy than anybody else in my life, and for him to kind of mold that and empower me has really helped me in my own career,” he said. “I am who I am in coaching because of how I was mentored in college and since then.”Stevens, meanwhile, raved about what he saw in Nored from Day 1.“Anybody that’s ever been around Ron knows he was born to lead,” said Stevens, who also mentioned that Nored lived at his house for half the time Nored worked in Boston. “He just has an unbelievable ambition to him and he loves the game, but he loves being around people and being a part of a team even more. He’s one of the best leaders I’ve ever coached or been around.”With a leader like that in the point guard slot, and with a talented star like Hayward alongside him, under the tutelage of Stevens, it’s no wonder why the 2010 Butler Bulldogs shocked the basketball world by nearly capturing an NCAA trophy.Many of the relationships that fueled that run were forged back in 2008 in Indianapolis. Who would have ever thought that a decade later, in Chapel Hill of all places, much of the band would get back together for one more pregame meal, this time, as opponents?
BOSTON – On the day before his second training camp with the Boston Celtics began, Guerschon Yabusele was already oozing with confidence and eagerness. “I know what we’re going to do and what they’re expecting me to do,” the 22-year-old forward told the media in his thick, French accent on Media Day. “I’m coming back with more energy and I’m just trying to help the team each minute I’m going to be on the court.”Through the first two games of preseason, Yabusele has accomplished those goals as well as any other player on the team.Over the course of 28 minutes, he has stuffed the stat sheet with 15 points on 7-of-11 shooting, six rebounds, three blocks, two assists, one steal and has committed only one turnover.Yabusele’s rookie campaign was filled with uncertainty, as he went back and forth between Boston and Portland, Maine – the home of the Celtics’ G League affiliate Maine Red Claws. He compiled just 235 regular-season minutes with the C’s last season, but his teammates saw flashes of potential during his short stints on the court.“I think that even last year I felt that he could do certain things,” frontcourt mate Al Horford said Monday after practice in Brighton. “It just probably wasn’t his time yet.“He’s a kind of guy that can score inside and create a lot of space with his body,” Horford elaborated. “He’s a good passer, he has a good feel for the ball, and he hustles. So, I just think that now when he gets the opportunities, he needs to make sure that his presence is felt. And I think he’s done that in the first couple of exhibition games.”Where Yabusele has truly established a presence is inside the paint. That’s where eight of his 11 shots attempts have come, and he’s converted them at a 75 percent rate.Coach Brad Stevens says the team made an emphasis during the summer to use Yabusele more in the post, where he can cause problems with his 6-foot-8, 260-pound frame. With that being said, he’s also agile enough to play the 4, so his versatility could give the Celtics multiple options coming off the bench.“I think that Guerschon’s ability to play not only as the 5, but also move his feet at the 4, may allow us to do some things against some smaller lineups,” said Stevens. “His ability to post and rebound and do all those things, I think, are pretty important.”Stevens admitted that because of Boston’s incredible depth, he’s not exactly sure what Yabusele’s role will be this season. However, the the coach insists that the Dancing Bear will play a part in the team’s journey. “Everybody gets their chance to impact and everybody has their chance to shine,” said Stevens. “There’s no question about that.  NBA seasons give you those opportunities, just by the sheer numbers of it.”While there is some uncertainty revolving around Yabusele’s playing time, just like there was last season, he is not at all concerned with his role.“I don’t really think about it,” he claimed. “I’m a competitor, so I’m going to use every minute, every second that I have to give them everything I’ve got. I don’t worry about the minutes, about anything that’s going to happen; I just try to control everything I can control.”While he may not know what to expect minutes-wise, Yabusele fully understands what the team wants out of him whenever he hits the floor. His job is to provide energy, versatility and to give the team a solid presence in the post. Through the first two games of the preseason, Yabusele has done all of the above to the best of his ability, and so far, it has paid off.
BOSTON – The Celtics will play their final preseason game with a roster that looks eerily similar to the one with which it ended last season – one without Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward.Irving stated Thursday night that he is experiencing sore ribs, which began to surface during Wednesday afternoon’s practice. Hayward, meanwhile, did not practice Wednesday due to a sore back.Neither player will travel with the team Friday afternoon to Cleveland, instead opting to remain in Boston for treatment with Boston’s medical staff.Terry Rozier is likely to start in Irving’s place, as he did Tuesday night against Cleveland at TD Garden. It remains to be determined as to who will start in place of Hayward, although the leading candidates are likely Marcus Morris and Marcus Smart.Smart, who is a point guard by trade but plays multiple positions thanks to his size, doesn’t believe that Irving’s and Hayward’s absences are issues for the team.“I don’t think it’s going to affect us in any harmful way,” he said before Friday’s practice at the Auerbach Center. “I think it will help.”How so? He explained.“It allows us to figure out how to play without those guys, and then when they come back, how to play with those guys,” Smart said. “So we get the best of both worlds.”Smart also noted that Irving and Hayward are two players who will be very easily worked back into the fold when the team resumes practice Tuesday afternoon.“They make everybody else’s lives easier,” he said. “They take a lot of attention off of other guys because of who they are. Everybody is locked in on those guys, so that opens the floor for everyone else on the team.”Ironically, their absences will open up a different type of opportunity Saturday night, one similar to what the team experienced last season.The Celtics stormed through the 2018 postseason, advancing all the way to Game 7 of the Conference Finals, while Irving and Hayward were out with injuries. Multiple players stepped up and played at a level they had never reached before during their NBA careers.So far during this preseason, however, that level of individual and team play has been missing. The C’s are trying to regain it, and Saturday night provides another opportunity to do so. Prior to Friday’s practice, Brad Stevens highlighted exactly what the team needs to improve.“We need to defend harder and better, and we need to really continue to improve our reads on the offensive end of the floor,” commented Brad Stevens. “Those are the two things that I’ll be looking at the closest.”Meanwhile, Smart is putting a heavy emphasis on making those adjustments and improvements during this particular game.“You’ve got to take advantage of it,” he said of the final exhibition contest. “It’s the last time we’ll see a different team (until Opening Night), so you’ve got to go out there and give it everything and get ready for the season, because this is it, we don’t have any more.”What the Celtics do have more of is opportunity for growth. They’ll just need to seize that opportunity Saturday night without Irving and Hayward, the same way they did a season ago.
BOSTON – The final identity of last season’s Celtics was playing hard in games.The initial identity of this season’s Celtics is playing hard in practice.That discrepancy is a problem, one from which the Celtics aren’t running away, and one they’re still searching to solve following the completion of their exhibition schedule.“I wish I had an answer for why we can’t translate how hard we play in practice for the last week or so into the games, and have the same structure of what we’re working on,” Kyrie Irving said Tuesday afternoon.On the same topic, Marcus Smart added, “This is one question I don’t know the answer to. I don’t know.”Brad Stevens said it Saturday night, and he said it again Tuesday afternoon: this team leaves it all out there on the practice court. When describing this season’s practice effort with last season’s practice effort, he used the word “similar.”Yet for some reason, it hasn’t translated to the game court.This season’s Celtics, although only four exhibition games deep, oftentimes looked lackadaisical as they dropped three of their contests. Defensively, they looked nothing like the team that played with a tenacious mindset and led the league in defensive rating a season ago.Stevens believes the difference in trends may be a hangover effect from last season’s electric run to the brink of the NBA Finals.“We got a lot of pats on the back for coming close (last season),” Stevens said Tuesday. “Unfortunately, I’ve been a part of teams like that before, and that doesn’t always help you at the start of the next season.”Neither does being praised all offseason, or being crowned by many as the favorite to win the Eastern Conference, or adding exceptional talent to the group that reached Game 7 of the Conference Finals.With all of that comes expectations, and it’s never easy to live up to expectations. Doing so requires effort – consistent effort, like that of which the team showcased just one season ago every time it took the court.There’s only one group that can take responsibility for relocating such a mindset.“Now it’s up to us as players to make that conscious choice to do it at a very high level, consistently,” said Irving, who went on to explain the nuances of what’s required from this team to improve its play.“We’re asking a lot of our players to be basketball savants now rather than just basketball players, like, just going out there like you have nothing to lose, nothing to worry about, just go out there and play. Like, we’re not that team anymore,” he said. “We have to be a lot smarter, a lot more diligent in what we’re doing out there, a lot more communicative.”During games, that is.The Celtics are already doing it on the practice court. They’re competing at a high level because they want to beat one another and hold bragging rights.It’s only a matter of time before that competitive spirit bleeds its way into game play. When that happens, Boston’s preseason play will be long forgotten.

WALTHAM, Mass. – Jae Crowder’s message to rookie Demetrius Jackson was simple: find a routine.He’s trying.Doing so is easier said than done for Jackson, because his playing status is drastically different now than it ever has been during his basketball life.Jackson has always been one of the best players on any court he dribbled on.  He was a McDonald’s All-American and an All-State performer during high school in Indiana.  He was an All-ACC performer during his four-year career at Notre Dame.Now, he’s simply fighting for a spot on the Celtics roster, and waiting for his number to be called.The waiting game has been a tough one for Jackson.  He played only seven total minutes during Boston’s first two preseason games, totaling just two points.  But during Saturday’s win over Charlotte, on a day Brad Stevens rested many of his top players, Jackson finally got his chance.The point guard logged 15 minutes of playing time and took advantage of every moment of it.  He scored nine points off the bench, the most of any Celtics reserve who played fewer than 20 minutes, to go along with two rebounds and two assists.It was a successful performance off the bench for a guy who has almost always opened up games on the court.  He was successful because he is beginning to find a routine as a reserve.That routine, oddly enough, is a bit unpredictable.“One of the things I do is with Coach (Brandon) Bailey,” Jackson revealed Monday morning.  “He just randomly grabs me at any time and we do a shooting drill and I have a certain number I want to reach.“So that kind of simulates just being grabbed off the bench.  You never know when you’re going to get called, and then you’ve got to make shots.”Jackson made half of his six shots during Saturday’s win, including a 2-for-3 performance from long range.The rookie also pointed out that his mental approach to games has needed to change while adjusting to his new role.“I just try to stay just mentally prepared, physically prepared,” he said.  “Try to work as hard as I can on (practice) days like today.  And then just keep my mind in the game, and you can do that by getting up and celebrating for your teammates, staying locked in.”Make no mistake about it: making such drastic adjustments is not easy for a basketball player.  This is a process for Jackson, one his teammates are walking him through.Crowder and Jonas Jerebko are two veterans who have been very active in trying to help Jackson build a foundation for a successful career.“You stay in this gym when no one else is here,” Crowder recalls telling Jackson.  “Don’t get too down on yourself, because you have one of the best jobs in the world: you’re playing professional basketball.“Just take it day by day.  Just come in every day, listen in practice and treat practices like games.”Jerebko’s leadership has been from more of a tactical perspective.“He has done a great job of just helping educate me,” Jackson said of Jerebko.  “He just talks to me about some of the reads off the screens, some of the things defensively that we try to do as a team, just so I can be more comfortable moving when I’m out there with the group.”Two weeks into his first training camp, Jackson is coming off of a solid performance during which he looked quite comfortable out on the court.  An added positive is that his teammates and coaches appear to be very comfortable with him, too.“I think he’s a real mature, business-oriented, tough-minded guy,” Stevens said, lauding the player he has known for years dating back to his days at Butler on the high school recruiting trail.  “He’s a great guy to have around, that’s for sure.”Crowder added his perspective on what Jackson brings to the table.“Demetrius plays very old school,” Crowder said.  “We were laughing about that the other day.  He doesn’t hurt himself.  He doesn’t turn the ball over.  He’s going to run the offense.  He’s not going to do anything he can’t do, and I like that about him.  He comes to work every day.”That’s all you can ask for from a rookie who’s learning a whole new lifestyle – and a whole new routine – during the infancy stages of his professional career.
BOSTON – There’s typically a disparity of skill between a basketball team’s first unit and second unit. The Boston Celtics are an exception to that trend.Boston boasts incredible depth from the top of its rotation to the back of its bench, and there’s been profound evidence of that during its intersquad exhibition matches this preseason.“There’s not been any difference as far as when they get out here in scrimmages,” C’s coach Brad Stevens told reporters ahead of Wednesday afternoon’s practice. “Those have all been pretty tight games whenever we’ve done that.”Take Tuesday afternoon’s scrimmage, for instance, which featured a back-and-forth, Green vs. White battle that ultimately carried into overtime. The scrimmage featured such great parity that no one knew who would step up into the hero role as the final seconds ticked away.Would it be Kyrie Irving who would get the job done, as he did on the first day of training camp? Or would it be Gordon Hayward? Al Horford? Marcus Morris? Terry Rozier?Nope. None of the above.It wound up being Guerschon Yabusele, a second year forward with less than 300 NBA minutes under his belt, who hit the game-winner to give the second unit the final edge over the first unit. Reserves hardly ever come out on top during practice scrimmages, but it’s a 50-50 toss-up every time Boston’s first and second units square off. “We’re trying to beat them every day,” backup point guard Terry Rozier said of facing the starters. “We’re trying to compete and we’re trying to make them work. We know every team is going to come after our whole team and every team wants to beat us, so in practice, we want to win every game and we want it to be known that we’ve got the better five.”The second unit’s success is driven by its collective tenacity. It contains a number of gritty, veteran leaders such as Rozier, Morris, Aron Baynes and Marcus Smart, who all make sure their teammates play with constant hunger.“I live for this,” Smart proclaimed. “I love the competitive nature that these guys and this team brings. We’ve got a lot of guys out here that are very talented, so when we get out here, you put them all on the court together, you’ve got a blood bath.”Strong intersquad competition is a necessity throughout the season, but it’s particularly valuable to the C’s this week. Boston has already gotten its entire preseason slate out of the way, and with nine days between games, they need a way to stay fresh and competitive.Having gone 1-3 during the preseason, the C’s also need to improve over the next week, so they are relying on each other to help expedite that process.“They’re pushing us every day and I feel like it’s making us better,” Horford said of facing the second unit. “It was very productive yesterday and we plan for it to be at that level all week.”If they can maintain such a high level of competition amongst themselves throughout the next week, the Celtics should be more than ready for battle in their season opener Oct. 16 against the Philadelphia 76ers.  Based upon their widespread talent and the relentless nature of their second unit, that shouldn’t be a problem at all.
BOSTON – When you think about the Boston Celtics, you think about their perimeter stars.Just be sure not to forget about the men in the middle.The Celtics may very well have the most talented and eclectic group of centers that they’ve ever had during the Brad Stevens era. There are five players on the roster who will see time at the center position, and each one of them brings something different to the table.Stevens commented Friday afternoon that Al Horford, Aron Baynes, Daniel Theis, Guerschon Yabusele and Robert Williams will all see action at center this season. Horford and Baynes keyed Boston’s run to the brink of the Finals a season ago, but the reintegration of Theis, the growth of Yabusele, and the addition of Williams has deepened the tool shed for Stevens.Prior to Friday’s practice, teammate Gordon Hayward rattled off a list of many of that group’s skills.“I think that Al gives us an option to play-make through him and he spreads the floor really well with his ability to shoot and take guys off the dribble,” Hayward began. “Baynes has done a great job of screening, rolling to the rim. He’s even, as you saw a little bit last year, step out and been able to knock down the 3.Hayward continued, “Rob has got incredible length and is able to alter shots, and I’ve definitely felt that in practice of him changing some of my looks when I try to go to the rim, and he’s only going to get better. Theis is a guy that knows how to play. We’ll play him at some 4 and some 5. He’s just got a great feel for the game and can do some of the similar things that Al can do for us.”Yabusele, who is more of a natural power forward but will see time at center, can also do many of the things that Horford does, but Yabu owns a much bulkier body. Stevens singled Yabusele out multiple times for his impact on games during the preseason.Add all five players together, with their wide range of body types and skill sets, and you’ve got the definition of depth and versatility. Stevens, arguably for the first time in his career with the Celtics, now has the opportunity to make nightly decisions at the center position based off of a myriad of factors rather than simply rotating a group of three players. The coach spoke Friday about what factors would play into such decisions.“Who you’re playing against. How you’re playing. How they’re fitting in with the guys around them,” he said. “Who has the most energy on that night, because maybe somebody else played more minutes than you had hoped.”There’s a lot that goes into it, and there are many different routes that Stevens can take. That’s the beauty of this crew of bigs: he has options.He’s got an All-Star in Horford. He’s got a defensive wall in Baynes. He’s got a rim-runner, shot-blocker and shooter in Theis. He’s got a big, athletic shooter in Yabusele. He’s got an energetic shot blocker and finisher in Williams.He’s got an eclectic group of bigs, the likes of which he’s never had before in Boston. Don’t forget about them.
BOSTON – The role of an NBA sixth man is to not only be a glue guy off the bench, but to also have the flexibility to step into the starting lineup if need be.Marcus Smart has been exactly that type of player for the Boston Celtics over the last five seasons, and Monday night’s game in New Orleans provided the latest example of his adjustability.Starting shooting guard Jaylen Brown was sidelined for the Celtics’ matchup against the Pelicans, and without hesitation, coach Brad Stevens penciled Smart’s name into the empty backcourt slot.Despite it being his first start of the season, Smart made a seamless transition into the starting rotation. In fact, his presence made the biggest difference in the game.The energy and intensity that the fifth-year guard brought out of the gate helped Boston to get out to a 34-21 lead after one quarter. And once they were up, the Celtics never looked back, running away with a 124-107 win.  During a team-high 40 minutes of action, Smart compiled eight points, five assists and a pair of rebounds. Most importantly, he was the key defensive stopper in the game, personally allowing just 14 points on 80 defensive possessions, while forcing a total of seven turnovers.Reporters were still buzzing at Wednesday afternoon's practice about Smart’s impact, prompting them to question Stevens if Smart's promotion to the starting rotation could be a permanent solution to help the team get on track after an 11-10 start.Stevens wouldn’t say if he was leaning one way or another, as he weighed the pros and cons of the situation. On one hand, he noted the great influence that Smart had on the team’s fast start, but the coach also pointed out the dilemma in potentially removing him from the second unit.“The problem with starting Marcus Smart is that he can’t bring his energy off the bench,” said Stevens, who also confirmed that Brown’s injury is day-to-day. “He’s a valuable guy in both of those areas (as a starter or as a reserve) for the same reason: that he does all of the intangible stuff to have success.”The intangible traits that Smart brings to the table are just as valuable to the second unit as they are to the first, which is what makes the looming decision so difficult to make.“In the past, it’s really aided us (to bring him in) at the six-minute mark of a first quarter,” said Stevens. “But clearly it aided us the other night at the start, so we’ll see how it goes from here.”One player who was aided by Smart’s presence on both ends of the floor was Kyrie Irving."On the offensive end it takes pressure off me being able to play off the ball sometimes," Irving said after the game. "My energy can get depleted coming up and down and directing the ball every single time. And having Marcus in there gave me that outlet to be able to get off the ball.”It’s just one more aspect for Stevens to consider as he weighs his options.No matter what the decision winds up being, Smart will undoubtedly accept it. He has always approached these matters selflessly, ever since the beginning of his sophomore campaign, when he surrendered the starting point guard job to Isaiah Thomas. “Anything can happen and you’ve got to be able to adapt to it,” said Smart. “Just because I got hurt and Isaiah started, I couldn’t let that affect how I played when I came in. Some guys are like that and see it as a negative because they have to come off the bench, but you can’t look at it that way. We’ve got 82 games, it’s a long season, and things are going to happen.”Regardless of what happens with regard to Smart's role, he'll maintain the same mindset that fueled Boston's win Monday night.“Whenever I’m out there I just try to play with the same energy, the same intensity and try to do everything right,” said Smart.That’s how he has approached his job from Day 1 here in Boston. And that’s why he is the perfect sixth man for the Celtics.
BOSTON – A little down time never hurt anyone, and when it comes to the Boston Celtics, it has and will do them plenty of good.For the second consecutive week, Boston has welcomed a rare break in its schedule that has allowed the team to both rest and refine during the holiday season. The Celtics had three consecutive non-game days last week, and it will have four consecutive non-game days this week.Those breaks in the schedule were badly needed after Boston played 21 games during the first six weeks of the season, including 13 on the road that featured a five-game, 11-day road trip and six road games against the Western Conference.“It gave us time to rest, especially those older guys like Al (Horford),” Marcus Smart joked before Tuesday’s practice. “But really, just to get our bodies back right and to get our minds right and get the focus back and regroup and everything like that … Sometimes you need that, especially with the schedule we’ve been having and constantly on the go.”Last week, the Celtics used Tuesday as a rest day and then regrouped for a hard practice Wednesday and a lighter practice Thursday. The Wednesday practice drew rave reviews for its level of competitiveness and its overall energy. That practice, coupled with the off day, set the team up for a very successful weekend of games.“Last week’s practice on, I believe it was Wednesday, was really good,” Brad Stevens said Tuesday. “I thought that that kinda spurred us through that week.”Added Jayson Tatum, “We definitely came out and played in the games the way we competed in practice. It definitely had carry-over.”Boston transferred its momentum from that practice over into a very challenging back-to-back against the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Minnesota Timberwolves over the weekend. Cleveland didn’t pose a great challenge Friday night, but following that game, the Celtics didn’t arrive at their hotel in Minnesota until after 4 a.m. EST. All they did was wake up the next day and take down the red-hot Timberwolves to complete a weekend sweep.After seeing how last week’s schedule yielded great results, Stevens is sticking to the same script this week.“Yesterday was a day off, but at the same time, everybody was in and everybody did something small, whether it was on the court, in the weight room, whatever the case may be, training room,” the coach said of Monday, which followed an off-day on Sunday. “And then today will be harder, and tomorrow will be light to get ready for Thursday night.”That’s when Boston will seek revenge against the New York Knicks on national television.Nearly two weeks ago, New York embarrassed the Celtics on their home court during a 117-109 victory. The Knicks led from start to finish during that game, and pulled ahead by as many as 28 points.The Celtics team that took the court that night was in the midst of a stretch that included five games in eight days, including a back-to-back against two very talented teams in Toronto and Utah. This situation will be far different.This time, Boston will head into its matchup with the Knicks rested and refined following a four-day gap of non-game days. The Celtics are hoping that those traits will carry them through Thursday night and beyond the same way they did last weekend.

SAN FRANCISCO - There may be no opponent in the league against which Marcus Smart is more important to the Celtics than when they take on the Warriors. Unfortunately for Boston, the star defensive guard will not be available for Saturday night’s primetime showdown in Oakland.Smart suffered hand lacerations prior to Wednesday night’s matchup with the LA Clippers and will miss approximately two weeks of action as they heal.“It’s unfortunate to see that,” Al Horford said of Smart’s injury. “Marcus is a teammate I have a lot of respect for and I’m going to stand by him. Whatever the decision was, he made a bad decision”Smart later tweeted that he “swiped at and hit a picture frame” as he suffered the injury. He returned to Boston to be evaluated by Drs. Tony Shena and Drew Terona at New England Baptist Hospital.Smart, in his fourth NBA season, is unquestionably one of the top perimeter defenders in the league. Despite playing as a reserve last season for Boston, he garnered 21 voting points and five First-Team votes for the NBA’s All-Defensive team. And he’s managed to improve at that end this season. Smart is allowing 0.846 points per possession this season, according to Synergy Sports, and that number ranks in the 78th percentile of the league. Last season, he allowed 0.932 points per possession, which ranked in the 40th percentile.Perimeter defense, bolstered by Smart’s presence for an average of 30.3 minutes per game, is a big reason why the Celtics are the top defensive team in the NBA. Boston owns a league-best defensive rating of 99.8, and it is the only team in the NBA with a defensive rating better than 100.5.But Saturday night, the Celtics will be taking on the most prolific offense in the NBA in the Warriors, a team that is boosted by three perimeter-based All-Stars. Golden State leads the NBA in offensive rating (113.8), points per game (116.1), field goal percentage (51.5 percent), 3-point percentage (39.6 percent) and assists per game (30.8).There is no more dynamic perimeter threesome in the league than Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson. Each player averages at least 20.5 points per game and shoots at least 42.0 percent from long distance. Curry, Durant and Thompson combine to average 74.0 PPG and shoot 43.3 percent from beyond the arc.Yet the Celtics have been able to overcome the Warriors more often than not during their last five meetings. Boston owns a 3-2 record against Golden State during that span, and Smart has played a key role in that success.Smart and the Celtics have limited Curry to 39.1 percent shooting from the field and 33.3 percent from long distance (five games), Thompson to 50.0 percent on field goals and 32.2 percent on 3s (four games), and Durant to 50.0 percent from the field and 42.9 percent from long distance (two games). Boston also limited the Warriors to 88 points during a 92-88 win on Nov. 16, which stands as Golden State’s second-lowest scoring effort of the season. Curry, Durant and Thompson all logged 31 or more minutes during that game.Saturday night could be different, however, without Smart on the floor.Golden State has won six of its last seven games and scored at least 123 points during its last two victories. Celtics head coach said of the Warriors’ recent stretch of offensive play, “They’re a joke. I don’t even know what to say.”This contest could turn into a joke if the Celtics don’t receive a boost from players who will receive more of an opportunity with Smart sidelined. Two players who will garner greater responsibility are Terry Rozier and Shane Larkin, and the team believes they’re ready.“We’ve always had that next-guy mentality,” said Jaylen Brown, “so when somebody goes down, it’s an opportunity for somebody to step up.”Horford singled out Rozier as an athletic defender who is able to chase players around screens. That’s an important ability while facing off against Thompson in particular, but also against Curry. Rozier has averaged only 19.5 minutes of playing time during four career games against Golden State, but he’ll likely see that number spike well into the 20s Saturday night.Larkin, meanwhile, is a player who Brad Stevens discussed at length. Stevens clearly believes that Larkin is capable of doing more than just holding his own against top opposing scorers.“Where we have been most impressed with his growth has been on the defensive end of the floor,” Stevens said Friday after Friday afternoon’s practice at the University of San Francisco. “I thought his minutes against Lou Williams were phenomenal the other day, and obviously these guys have four All-Stars on their team so you’re going to need to throw as many bodies at them as possible.”The Celtics would love for one of those bodies to be Smart, but that’s not going to happen. Smart is instead back in Boston with hand lacerations, and Boston will need to lean heavily on Rozier and Larkin to get it done against the defending-champion Warriors without him.
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. – The Boston Celtics are on Tobacco Road to play their first preseason game tonight against the Charlotte Hornets at the famous Dean Smith Center, widely known as the Dean Dome, on the campus of the University of North Carolina.That fact is rubbing some of the Celtics better than others.This area of the country is known most for its deep-rooted rivalry between the basketball programs at UNC and Duke University, whose campuses are situated less than 10 miles away from each other in central North Carolina. The rivalry forever remains in the blood of anyone who has ever participated in it.As Kyrie Irving said Friday morning, “Once a Blue Devil, always a Blue Devil.”But you didn’t need to hear him make that statement to know it was true.Irving and teammate Jayson Tatum, each of whom attended one year of school at Duke, showed up to Boston’s morning shootaround Friday morning proudly donning Duke basketball gear. This came just hours after they had traveled Thursday night to Duke to have dinner with the Blue Devils basketball team.Both players are clearly proud of where they come from, and they wanted everyone who saw them on the UNC campus to know about it. That being said, they both made it be known that they still hold the Tar Heels program in high regard.“Obviously there’s a great rivalry between Duke and UNC, but there’s an incredible respect between both universities because of what we’ve accomplished over time,” said Irving. “Being so close in mileage and then being so enriched with tradition, it’s awesome. So nothing but respect, but obviously, if you go to Duke, you represent Duke. If you go to UNC, you represent UNC.”Tatum, too, acknowledged UNC’s tradition, which features six national championships and the launching point for Michael Jordan’s illustrious basketball career.“It’s a real special place, I’m not going to lie,” said Tatum, who also noted that he nearly attended UNC to play for coach Roy Williams. “They have a lot of history here. A lot of national championships and great players who came through here.”Irving was unable to play at the Dean Dome due to a toe injury that he suffered during his freshman season. He was forced to watch the rivalry from the sideline. Tatum, meanwhile, played one game in the building and he remembers it well.“The last time we played here we lost, but it’s cool,” he said. “Obviously when I played here it was to capacity and the gym was rocking, and it was cool. A great experience to be a part of that rivalry.”Tatum and Irving would much rather be playing this game at Duke’s Cameron Indoor Stadium, but head coach Brad Stevens, who became famous during his collegiate coaching career at Butler, has no gripes.Stevens is a historian of the game. He enjoys playing and practicing in new gyms around the country. Shockingly, though, he had never been inside the Dean Dome prior to Friday morning’s shootaround, which made him giddy to soak in the environment of one of college basketball’s most historic buildings.“I think anytime you get a chance to play in one of these unbelievable college programs and in their building in a place where basketball really matters, I think that’s a fun thing for everybody,” he said prior to Boston’s shootaround. “I haven’t seen anything but the hallway yet, so I’m looking forward to getting out on the court and seeing the Dean Dome in person.”Stevens went on to comment on the coaching history inside the building, highlighted by Dean Smith, for whom the building is named, and the current coach, Williams.“Dean Smith is one of the most studied coaches in all of sports, and for all the right reasons,” he said. “And then obviously Roy and his run has been incredible.”Much of that success has come against Duke, to the dismay of Irving and Tatum. Both players are yet to experience a win inside the historic Dean Dome. They plan on changing that tonight.

CLEVELAND – Brad Wanamaker is only 10 days into his first NBA preseason, but it's already clear that he doesn't fit the mold of a typical rookie.The 6-foot-4 combo guard has displayed high levels of maturity, leadership and basketball IQ during his short time with the Boston Celtics, which makes it seem as though he's been going through this type of process for years.Well, that’s because he has been. As a matter of fact, this rookie has more professional basketball experience under his belt than more than half of the players on the Celtics roster.After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in 2011, Wanamaker spent seven years playing in some of the top international leagues in the world, all while achieving monumental success. Now, at 29 years old, the Philadelphia native has finally reached his goal of making it to the NBA, and he’s more than ready to get to work for his new squad.“At the beginning of the summer, when I first signed with Boston, it was a great moment for me,” Wanamaker told Celtics.com before Saturday morning’s shootaround in Cleveland. “But now that I’m here, it’s all about working hard to find my way onto the court.”Wanamaker is aware of Boston’s tremendous depth, but he believes that the knowledge he gained overseas will help him to make an impact on this Celtics team.“Going over there, you’ve gotta learn how to play the game,” Wanamaker said of his international experiences in Italy, France, Germany and Turkey. “It’s not all about just scoring and running up and down the court – you’ve gotta learn how to set your teammates up, how to run sets, how to be a leader on the team. It helped me tremendously and just helped my overall game in understanding how to move and how to lead a team.”And lead, he did. Wanamaker was on three title-winning teams while playing overseas, for two of which he was named Finals MVP. He was also a two-time Turkish League All-Star, a two-time German Basketball Bundesliga All-Star, and he earned the 2016 German BBL MVP while playing alongside Daniel Theis on Brose Bamberg.Experiencing success at the NBA level will be a whole new challenge for Wanamaker, but he says the transition has been a smooth one so far.“It’s been going great,” he said as he laced up his sneakers for shootaround at Quicken Loans Arena ahead of Boston’s preseason finale against the Cavaliers. “I’m still adjusting a little bit, but I think it’s more so just me slowing the game down for myself. Everything else is pretty much going well – the physicality, the speed and everything – I just gotta slow it down to my pace.”The Celtics’ coaching staff has seen promising signs from Wanamaker over the last 10 days. Brad Stevens has praised the newcomer’s playmaking abilities, his versatility, and most of all, his knowledge of the game. “He’s a really bright guy,” Stevens said Saturday morning. “He’s played basketball for great coaches all over the world in a lot of different situations and you can tell that he reads situations really well. He’s going to adjust, as time goes on, to the NBA game and the different challenges that come along with that, but I’ve been really happy with him.”Wanamaker has played in all three of Boston’s preseason games thus far, having compiled eight points, eight rebounds and three assists over 34 minutes of play. He could see a bit of extra action during Saturday night’s preseason finale, given that neither Gordon Hayward (lower back) nor Kyrie Irving (ribs) made the trip to Cleveland. “Any time you step on that court, it’s an opportunity,” said Wanamaker. “And with Kyrie and Gordon out tonight, it’s an even bigger opportunity. Maybe I’ll get some more minutes out there just to show what I’m capable of doing.”Wanamaker has already shown his teammates and coaches that he’s more capable than many rookies in this league, and that’s because his experience and knowledge of the game is beyond that of most first-year players. He still has to feel out the pace of the NBA in order to get fully comfortable, but once he does, he could wind up being an important piece to Boston’s puzzle.
CHICAGO – Offensive consistency – or lack thereof – may have been Boston’s biggest issue during the first 18 games of the season, as it got off to a 9-9 start while owning the fourth-worst offensive rating (104.3) in the NBA.Over the last six games, however, offensive consistency may have become Boston’s biggest strength.So, what’s caused the complete 180 on that end of the court?“Everybody is starting to play together," answered Marcus Smart ahead of Saturday morning's shootaround in Chicago.  “There’s just more ball movement. And it’s a good sign because everybody is smiling, everybody is actually having fun on the court now and not really worried about stats or anything like that. We just go out there and we worry about winning.”While the Celtics are not worried about individual stats, it’s worth pointing out a team statistic that backs up Smart’s claim about better ball movement. Through the first 18 games, the Celtics averaged just 275.1 passes per game, ranking them 25th in the league in that department. Over the last six games, Boston has dished out 327.0 passes per game, which is good for fifth in the league during that stretch.That’s a stat that coach Brad Stevens can get behind.“Well, we needed to be better at moving it, be better at getting to spots quicker,” said Stevens. “I think that part of it is probably pace, and part of it (like Smart said) is getting better at playing together.”As to why the C’s weren’t playing as well together before – well, they just hadn’t begun to form their identity yet.“I think every team has to go through some type of tough time; this one was just ours,” said Smart. “Everybody’s story is different, every team is different, so what other people go through, we might not have to go through and vice versa.”While it wasn’t the most enjoyable experience, going through that adversity has undoubtedly made the Celtics stronger as a unit.“I think that we’ve just been doing a great job of trusting each other,” said Kyrie Irving, “having everybody touch the ball during certain possessions, being aware of what the defense is trying to take away from us and then taking advantage of our mismatches.”As a result, the Celtics have seen a massive surge in scoring. Through the first 18 games, Boston had averaged just 106.0 points per game, with 54.8 of those points created from assists. Over the last six contests, the C’s have put up a league-high 119.3 PPG, with assists leading to 71.2 of those points. They’ve also scored at least 115 points in four consecutive contests, marking the longest such streak since 1990. And Jaylen Brown believes that this is only a taste of what is yet to come.“I think having more offensive cohesion helps on the defensive end and vice versa, so I think we’re going to start playing some really good basketball in the next couple of weeks,” said Brown. “We’ve still got a tremendous upside, so we’re just going to try to keep growing and improving each and every game.”The C’s will look to continue their offensive – and overall – development Saturday night, when they take on the Bulls at United Center.
BOSTON – Rajon Rondo, since being traded by the Celtics four years ago, has made numerous returns to Boston while suiting up in a variety of uniforms. Thursday’s homecoming will be the most peculiar of them all.That’s because the former Celtics All-Star will be representing the team that was his arch-rival for eight and a half seasons in Boston – the Los Angeles Lakers.“It’s a little strange,” Rondo admitted Thursday morning of the prospect of wearing purple and gold at TD Garden later that night. “But I’ve been back in other uniforms as well. It’s still always home.”Rondo left “home” in December of 2014 when the Celtics traded him to Dallas. He has since made additional stops in Sacramento, Chicago and New Orleans, respectively, before landing in L.A. this past offseason. Playing for the Lakers has also given Rondo the opportunity to suit up alongside one of his former personal rivals in LeBron James. Though, injuries have derailed both of their seasons, so they’ve only played together 12 times during the Lakers’ first 54 games.“I’m trying to stay healthy,” Rondo said, having just returned two weeks ago from surgery on his right ring finger. “It’s been a long season, obviously with ups and downs, but for the most part, for me mentally, I’m just trying to stay healthy and do the best I can when I’m on the court, off the court, to help the team.”On the court, Rondo has been his typical self as a primary facilitator and a double-double machine. In 20 games, he has averaged 8.8 points, 7.7 assists and 5.0 rebounds per game, all while logging seven double-doubles. In six games since returning from the surgery, he has upped those marks to 9.8 PPG, 9.8 APG and 6.3 RPG.Even when not playing, Rondo has found ways to impact the team off the court as a leader for the young Lakers. It’s a role that he has grown into and embraced for a number of teams over the last few years.“Since I went to Sacramento (in 2015), I was almost the oldest guy on the team and I was 28,” Rondo said. “So, at 32 now, I still feel good physically and mentally. There’s still a couple of guys on the team that are older than me, but I’ll accept any role I’m given. It’s just about leadership and helping all the young guys.”Rondo began developing his leadership skills in Boston, where he played under the tutelage of Kevin Garnett. A number of KG’s lessons have stuck with the point guard throughout his travels. “You just can’t pick and choose when you want to be a leader,” Rondo explained as one of those lessons. “It has to be every day. You can’t wake up when you’re not feeling well and go out here and not give your team your best effort or your best leadership skills. So, me personally, I’ve learned that a long time ago from my vets – KG in particular – it’s just being a consistent leader every day.”Rondo will continue to put those leadership skills to the test Thursday night in the house that raised him, as he returns to Boston in peculiar fashion – as a member of the arch-rival Lakers.
BOSTON - The last time Doc Rivers coached Avery Bradley on the TD Garden sideline was nearly five years ago. At the time, a 22-year-old Bradley was just finishing his third NBA season with the Boston Celtics, while Rivers was wrapping up his ninth and final campaign as the team's head coach.Now, as members of the Los Angeles Clippers, the coach-player duo will take the parquet floor once again Wednesday night, but under very different circumstances than they have experienced together before: As opponents of the Celtics.Five years ago, when Rivers left the C's for LA, Bradley was still in the development phase of his career. The guard since blossomed into one of the most respected two-way players in the league, all while Rivers admired his progress from afar.Fate placed them back together two weeks ago when the Clippers landed Bradley in a blockbuster deal that sent franchise cornerstone Blake Griffin to the Detroit Pistons. The acquisition delighted Rivers because it gave him a unique opportunity to work with a player that he helped develop years ago."Avery is such a different player than when I coached him," Rivers said Wednesday morning before taking on his former team. "He was so young back then. We wasted the first year trying to get him as a point guard, and then we realized he's more of a (shooting) guard. Added the 19-year NBA head coach, "He's just a heck of a player. His offensive game has just opened up so much more. It's really interesting, because you don't get this opportunity very often when you have a young guy and then you get him back. But it's been really cool to see the difference and the growth in Avery."Bradley attributes his growth over the years to the initial tutelage that Rivers provided him. He says that Rivers was always hard on him during his early years, but he believes that it was tough love that was meant to generate motivation in order to get the best out of him. "Doc was someone that taught me discipline." recalled Bradley, who spent seven years with the Celtics until being traded this past summer to Detroit. "He stayed on me consistently for my first two years in the NBA. I was the person that he yelled at basically every single day. So, he definitely helped me grow. Bradley has only played five games with the Clippers since joining them, but the 27-year-old starting guard seems to have had a positive impact on the team so far. LA is 4-1 with a 101.5 defensive rating (fifth in the league) during games that Bradley has played, compared to a 25-25 record and a 106.3 defensive rating (16th in the league) without him.The Clippers will look to continue to build off that recent success Wednesday night when Bradley and Rivers reunite on the parquet floor with the hope of handing their former team a loss.

BOSTON - NBA, meet Jared Sullinger.  Jared Sullinger, meet the NBA.You two should get to know each other, because you’ll be hanging out for a while.The Boston Celtics had an intuition back on June 28, 2012, that Sullinger could be the steal of the NBA Draft.  That’s why they opted to select the big man with their first pick, which was 21st overall.The fact that Sullinger was still available at No. 21 tells us that not many teams agreed with Boston’s talent assessment.  Those teams believed something was wrong with this not-so-chiseled 20-year-old out of Ohio State.Sullinger had health issues.  He was too chubby.  He was too short.  He was something – something bad enough to prevent 16 teams from selecting him ahead of Boston.  The thought obviously never donned on those teams that Sullinger could become a game-changer for years to come.Seven months later, the Celtics can say, "Thank you," and, “We told you so,” to all of those teams.  The C's were correct, and that fact is ringing loud and clear from Boston.Sullinger is one of the biggest reasons why the Celtics are currently riding a season-best four-game winning streak.  He is a rebounding machine; a machine the Celtics have long been missing.Sullinger reeled in a Celtics-season-high 16 rebounds during Wednesday’s win over the Suns, and he has averaged 10.0 rebounds per game during Boston’s winning streak.  This isn’t an aberration, either.  This has been a regularity for some time now.  In fact, Sullinger has played only 35 games thus far in his NBA career, but he is already one of the greatest rebounders in the league.That’s right – a rookie who is playing on a championship-caliber team has already become a top-20 rebounder in the league.  As a Celtics fan, tell me that’s not a satisfying meal.Sullinger feeds on rebounds and he takes a simple approach to explaining why that is the case.“You gotta have a go-get-it attitude when it comes to rebounding, and that’s what I have,” he said after Wednesday’s win.Doc Rivers has known for years that Sullinger possesses that unique attitude.  Boston’s coach watched Sullinger pull in loads of rebounds against his son, Austin Rivers, during their years of battles on the AAU circuit.So what is he, other than a rebounding machine?“He’s just – he’s round,” Rivers joked.  “But he has great feet, he really does.  And you don’t appreciate that for a while when you watch him.  He’s quick and he has great feet.”And that’s on top of the incredible basketball IQ that the Celtics have raved about since Day 1.  That combination has some of the all-time greats like Kevin Garnett already using the word “great” to describe Sullinger, a guy who can’t even walk into a bar for a drink yet.“Obviously his timing, body positioning.  He has the perfect body for rebounding,” Garnett said.  “He can take the pounding and bump a little bit and he has great anticipation when it comes to the ball, and he has great hands.  Put all that in the pot, you got Jared Sullinger.  That’s what makes him great.”This doesn’t make sense, does it?  Sixteen teams passed on this kid.  They didn’t think he was legit.  Now, after 35 games, he’s playing as one of the top rebounders in the NBA and is gaining superlatives like “great” from future Hall of Famers?Rivers isn’t taken aback by any of that.  He saw this coming all along.“I keep saying, ‘Rebounds translate.’  You know?” Rivers said, alluding to the fact that great collegiate rebounders are usually the same in the pros.  “Most of the great rebounders aren’t that tall, when you think about it.  They’re big, they’re physical, and they have great instincts.”Sullinger seemingly has all of those attributes in tow.  He’s a 6-foot-9 body that weighs in at 260 pounds.  Inside that body is a set of eyes and a brain that instantaneously connect the dots of rebounding.  It's hard to believe that such a combination could tumble down 21 flights of the NBA Draft ladder.But it did.  Right into the Celtics' lap.  Wednesday night, Rivers recalled three words that passed through his mind when he realized that had happened:  “Fortunate.  Lucky.  Nice,” he said.It doesn’t take a genius to understand why Rivers felt that way.  We’re only 35 games into Sullinger’s rookie season, but from the looks of it, he’s going to be around for a while.  As of Jan. 9, 2013, he is the steal of the 2012 NBA Draft, and the Celtics couldn’t be happier to have played the role of thieves.
BOSTON – Marcus Smart signed a new contract with the Boston Celtics last week, so we’re celebrating his return by reliving some of the top moments of his career thus far. From his plethora of game-winning, hustle plays to his timely offensive performances there were plenty of moments to choose from, but we’ve managed to narrow the list down to five. So, without further ado, it’s time to take a trip down memory lane.By Game 14 of his rookie season, Marcus Smart made it clear that he was going to be a one-of-a-kind type of NBA player. While facing off against the Brooklyn Nets on Dec. 26, 2014, the 20-year-old point guard performed his first highlight hustle play, and it helped set the stage for a tenacious career.During the third quarter of the matchup, Nets point guard Jarrett Jack was carrying the ball up the court when he briefly lost his handle. Smart seized the opportunity by diving on the floor for the loose ball. Just as Smart grabbed ahold of the rock, Brooklyn big man Kevin Garnett came flying in to try to jar it loose, but Smart acted quickly and tossed it over his head to a streaking Jeff Green for an easy fast-break dunk.The Big Ticket is not one who typically compliments opposing players mid-game, but even he was impressed by Smart’s persistence. As soon as Smart got up, Garnett walked over to him, patted him on the chest and let the first-year-guard know he had made a good play.“Just that one little compliment from KG meant so much,” Smart later reflected in a Players’ Tribune article. “At that time in my rookie year, it was the dose of confidence I needed to keep playing my style of basketball.”Smart’s style of basketball can best be described with one word: Hustle. And diving on a loose ball has become his signature hustle play. In fact, the act has become so common for Smart that he has earned the nickname “The Cobra.” And fans will never forget the first time he struck his prey.Marcus Smart’s first trip back to his collegiate state of Oklahoma was the highlight performance of his rookie year. However, his season-high 25-point effort on March 18, 2015 was marred by a 37-point performance by Russell Westbrook and a 122-118 defeat at the hands of the Oklahoma City Thunder.Fortunately, Smart had another career night in store for his next trip back to OKC.On Nov. 15, 2015, the sophomore guard set a new career high with 26 points on 9-of-14 shooting. He added eight rebounds, five assists, a block and a steal to the effort while only committing one turnover.On the other side of the ball, he helped limit Westbrook to a dismal shooting performance, holding the superstar point guard to a 5-of-20 effort from the field, including 2-of-10 from long range, while forcing him to commit four turnovers.Smart’s strong, two-way effort led Boston to a 100-85 win at Chesapeake Energy Arena, and his 26-point performance remains tied for his regular-season career high.With six games left in the 2014-15 regular season, the Celtics found themselves sitting on the outside of playoff contention. They had lost six of their last 10 games heading into their April 4 matchup in Toronto, and things were not looking good as they trailed the Atlantic Division-leading Raptors 116-115 with 2.6 seconds left in overtime.However, a miracle, last-second bucket from Boston’s rookie point guard saved the game – and possibly the season.With time for just one play, Celtics swingman Evan Turner inbounded the ball to Isaiah Thomas, who was cutting in from the back court. Without breaking stride, Thomas sprinted to the hoop for a potential game-winning layup. However, Toronto’s entire defense collapsed on Thomas, so he couldn’t find a hole to the basket. His only option was to shovel the ball off to Smart, who was cutting in from the right corner.With less than one second remaining at this point, Smart barely had enough time to catch the rock. When it found his fingertips he immediately tossed it forward like a hot potato and it somehow bounced perfectly off the backboard and through the net just as the buzzer sounded.The bucket gave Boston a 117-116 victory and completely shifted the team’s momentum. The C’s went on to win the final six games of the regular season and squeezed into the postseason with the East’s seventh seed.The Celtics had only 19 minutes to make up a 21-point deficit on May 21, 2017 against the Cleveland Cavaliers, or else they would be facing a 3-0 series deficit in the Eastern Conference Finals.Without leading scorer Isaiah Thomas, who had suffered a season-ending hip injury during Game 2, this task seemed impossible.Thomas’ replacement, however, did everything in his power to fill the offensive void, and it proved to be just enough to get Boston over the hump and into the win column.Smart, making his first start of the postseason, erupted for a career-best 27 points on 8-of-14 shooting, including 7-of-10 from 3-point range. He tacked on seven assists, five rebounds and a pair of steals, all while helping to limit LeBron James to just 11 points – the lowest scoring effort at home of his postseason career.Smart’s overall performance boosted the C’s to an unlikely, 111-108 win at Quicken Loans Arena, bringing Boston within one game of the Cavs. Cleveland would go on to win the next two games to capture the series, but Smart’s Game 3 offensive outpour still stands as the top performance of his career.You’re probably wondering how the top performance of Smart’s career could possibly be outranked on this list. The keyword of this list, however, is “moment.” And there is one moment from Smart’s career that stands high above all others.On Dec. 28, 2017, the Celtics staged one of the most impressive comebacks in franchise history, storming back from a 26-point second-half deficit to top the league-leading Houston Rockets. Even more spectacular than the comeback itself, however, was how Smart won the game for the Celtics without even touching the ball.After Jayson Tatum cut Boston’s deficit to 98-97 with 7.3 seconds left, Smart turned his attention to James Harden. Smart knew Houston would be looking to get the ball into the hands of its superstar, so he draped himself all over Harden in an effort to shut him out of the play.Harden became frustrated by the suffocating defense, so he threw an elbow at Smart’s chest and got called for an offensive foul.The Celtics, out of timeouts, quickly inbounded the ball into the post to Al Horford, who canned a hook shot with 3.7 seconds left to give Boston its first lead of the game. Smart didn’t come close to setting any career highs that night, but his career hasn’t been defined by statistics. It’s been defined by game-winning, hustle plays – and this was the best of the best. 
BOSTON – Celtics fans can begin marking up their calendars now that the 2018-19 regular season schedule has officially been released. We’d like to aid the process by narrowing down the top games on the slate.We’ve ranked the most anticipated matchups of the season in order of intrigue. So, get out your pens and jot down these dates because you do not want to miss out on the following games.The Milwaukee Bucks’ last trip to Boston ended in heartbreak – a Game 7 loss in the first round of the 2018 Playoffs that came in blowout fashion. On the first day of November, the Bucks will have their shot at revenge while playing on national television. Milwaukee will look a little different this year with the addition of Brook Lopez to the frontcourt and the subtraction of Jabari Parker, as well as a new and proven head coach in Mike Budenholzer. But of course, the main attraction will be rising superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, who showed during last spring’s epic seven-game battle why opposing teams should “Fear the Deer.”Celtics-Lakers matchups at STAPLES Center have always been cherished events, but this season’s bout in Los Angeles should carry extra meaning for both squads. That’s because it will be the first time that LeBron James will host the C’s inside his new palace. Sitting atop a throne of purple and gold on Feb. 7, King James will look to add his mark to the storied rivalry while playing in front of Lakers Nation. The Celtics, of course, will try to spoil the moment for James by snagging a feel-good win on their archrival’s home court.The Houston Rockets blasted opponents apart last season for a league-leading 65 regular-season wins. One team that brought them down to Earth, however, was the Celtics. Boston put up two spectacular fights against the Rockets, beginning with an epic, 26-point comeback win at TD Garden that was highlighted by a pair of last-second charges that Marcus Smart drew against James Harden. The Celtics later traveled to Houston and fought the Rockets in a back-and-forth battle all the way to the finish line, before falling 123-120. Those two clashes left fans salivating for more, and they’ll get another taste on Dec. 27 when the C’s travel to Toyota Center for their first of two regular-season matchups against the Rockets.When the schedule officially came out Friday afternoon, this was likely the first game Gordon Hayward Circled on his calendar. After missing all but five minutes of last season with an ankle injury, the All-Star wing will finally get to experience his long-awaited homecoming to Salt Lake City, where he spent the first seven campaigns of his career. This will be a special night for Hayward and all Utah Jazz fans as he takes the Vivint Smart Arena court for the first time since signing with the Celtics.Over the last three seasons, there is only one team in the NBA that has a winning record on the road against the dynastic Golden State Warriors. That team is the Boston Celtics. Boston was the only squad  in the league to beat the Warriors at Oracle Arena during both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons, and it barely lost last year’s matchup at Golden State by a mere four points. The C’s will look to add to their recent stretch of success at Oracle on March 5 when they make their lone trip of the season to San Francisco Bay.Now that LeBron James is out of the East, many NBA pundits believe the Eastern Conference crown will belong to either Boston or Toronto by season’s end. The Celtics make a strong case as the favorites of the East because they are returning two stars in Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving, both of whom were sidelined during the team’s 2018 run to the Conference Finals. Toronto, the reigning one seed of the East, makes a case as well, thanks to the acquisition of superstar forward Kawhi Leonard. Who will ultimately come out on top? We won’t find that out until the spring. However, Game 2 of the regular season in Toronto should provide a good indication of how the two teams match up.Last season marked the first time in franchise history that the Celtics hosted a Christmas Day game in Boston. That tradition will continue into this season, as they are set to host the Philadelphia 76ers Dec. 25 at TD Garden. The holiday classic will begin at 5:30 p.m., so there will be plenty of time to spend with family and friends during the day before tuning into the evening showdown on ABC.With as much hype as there is surrounding Boston and Philly’s Christmas clash, there’s even more excitement leading up to their Opening Night matchup at TD Garden. The Celtics and Sixers rejuvenated their historic rivalry last spring during the Eastern Conference Semifinals, which Boston walked away from as 4-1 victors. The emotions of that series will certainly return Oct. 16 when the next chapter of the rivalry begins. Combining those emotions with the anticipated returns of Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving and Daniel Theis will set the stage for one heck of a season-opening experience.The two-time defending NBA-champion Warriors will come to Beantown on Jan. 16, and they will look more fearsome than ever. As if the combination of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson wasn’t enough, Golden State went out and snagged DeMarcus Cousins off the market, giving it a potential starting lineup of nothing but All-Stars. The C’s on the other hand, boast a trio of All-Stars of their own, as well as a couple of young, rising studs, each of whom should be able to do their part in giving the Warriors a run for their money.The Celtics-Lakers rivalry cooled down a bit over recent years, but a couple of acquisitions by L.A. this summer have allowed the matchup to once again become the hottest ticket in town. The addition of LeBron James alone would have been enough to rekindle the historic feud, but adding former Celtic star Rajon Rondo onto L.A.’s roster as well should make things all the more interesting when the purple and gold come to Boston. James, Rondo and the new-look Lakers will make their only stop of the season at TD Garden on Feb. 7, in what should be the most intriguing matchup of the Celtics’ season.
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics begin training camp in less than one month, so it’s time we break down the roster and provide an idea of what the team’s depth chart will look like heading into the 2018-19 Season. Rather than classifying the players with the traditional 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 positional tags, we are taking a page out of coach Brad Stevens’ book by placing each athlete into one of the  following three roles.We begin this series with arguably the most important role on the court – the ball-handling position.Boston has a number of guys who are capable of steering the offense, and it’ll often have multiple ball handlers on the court at once to keep opposing defenses honest.Here are the players who will be controlling the pace for the Celtics this season:Kyrie Irving gave Celtics Nation a taste of dominant scoring and world-class handles during his inaugural, injury-shorted season in Boston. Now, fully recovered from knee surgery and chomping at the bit to return to the court, the five-time All-Star could produce an even more impressive campaign the second time around.Irving averaged a team-high 24.4 points per game last season, while shooting 49.1 percent from the field, 40.8 percent from 3-point range, and dishing out 5.1 assists per game. He accomplished all of that despite dealing with persistent knee soreness caused by tension wire that had been implanted during a previous surgery in 2015.In late March, Irving opted to go under the knife and remove the wire, marking an end to his phenomenal campaign. The offseason was a period of healing for the 26-year-old point guard, but now he’s back at full health and is ready to run the Celtics’ offense once again.The fact that Irving was able to produce such impressive numbers and dazzling plays last season despite facing continual irritation indicates that his second season in green could be even more spectacular, as long as he maintains his health.Perfectly complementing Irving’s explosive offense is the tenacious defense provided by his back-up, Marcus Smart.With a new contract in hand, Smart will continue with his role as Boston’s sixth man, being a glue guy off the bench who is capable of providing spot starts for Irving if needed.Smart, too, was limited last season due to injury, having undergone hand surgery in mid-March. However, he was able to return to action midway through the first round of the Playoffs to help spark Boston on a tremendous postseason run.Smart took on more of a playmaking role during his fourth season with the team, averaging 10.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and a career-high 4.8 assists per game over 54 regular season contests. As Boston’s longest-tenured player, he has also developed into one of the team’s primary vocal leaders, both on the court and in the locker room.Last season’s injuries to both Irving and Smart opened the door for Terry Rozier. The eager, young point guard seized the opportunity by bursting into the national spotlight with authority.After spending the first two and a half seasons of his career as a role player, Rozier finally earned his way into the starting lineup during a Jan. 31 matchup against the New York Knicks. He answered the call with his first career triple-double, officially marking the birth of “Scary Terry.”Rozier lived up to his newfound moniker by averaging 15.1 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game over the last 29 contests of the regular season, seeing 16 starts during that span. His success magnified during the postseason, as he started all 19 of Boston’s playoff games and produced 16.5 PPG, 5.3 RPG and 5.7 APG.Rozier’s role will likely diminish with the return of Irving, but his continuing development and contributions to last season’s playoff run will surely enable him to earn significant playing time this coming season. He and Smart together should make one heck of a second-unit backcourt tandem with their collective tenacity and fearlessness on both ends of the court.Brad Wanamaker may be a rookie by NBA terms, but the 29-year-old combo guard still has more professional experience under his belt than half of the Celtics roster. After playing four years of college ball at the University of Pittsburgh, Wanamaker made his way over to Italy in 2011 to start his pro career. Over the course of seven years, he bounced around from France to Germany to Turkey, and also had a short stint with the Austin Toros of the NBA G League (formerly the D-League) in 2012.Wanamaker collected numerous accolades while he was overseas, including the 2015 German Basketball Bundesliga Finals MVP, the 2016 German BBL MVP and the Turkish Finals MVP. He was also a two-time Turkish League All-Star, a two-time German BBL All-Star and the 2015 German BBL All-Star Game MVP. On top of all of that, he won two German BBL championships alongside Celtics big man Daniel Theis, one Turkish League championship and one D-League championship.Last season in the Euroleague, Wanamaker averaged 11.3 points, 3.8 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game. The most valuable trait he has to offer is his versatility on both ends of the court, which should allow him to fit into Stevens’ system seamlessly as either a ball handler or a wing.
KINGSTON, Mass. – A case of knee tendonitis is preventing Robert Williams from partaking in 5-on-5 competition during the waning weeks of summer, but the Celtics rookie is doing everything in his power to get back to full health by the time training camp commences in late September.Williams, whose Summer League session was cut short by the injury, has been putting in early-morning workouts over the past few weeks at the team’s practice facility in Brighton, working with the Celtics’ trainers and coaches to fortify both his body and mind. “I’m strengthening places I need to strengthen,” Williams said Wednesday afternoon during an Arbella Home Court Makeover unveiling in Kingston, Massachusetts. “Obviously my knee, obviously knowing what’s going on out there on the court, knowing the calls before (coach Brad Stevens) throws me in a 5-on-5 game. He’s been teaching me the past couple days, just hammering in the calls, all the play names, all the nicknames for things, so it’s just been a great perspective, a great opportunity.”Williams lauded Stevens’ active approach, noting that the coach even joined him for a bike-conditioning workout Wednesday morning.“He's one of the most hands-on coaches I've ever worked with," said Williams. “[All of] the coaches have been hands-on, on and off the court. But on the court, just stuff like getting out of screens faster, knowing calls. If I’m ICE’ing, get down right away. Just put me up to speed for when training camp does start to roll in so I know what’s going on.”Williams has been a mainstay at the Auerbach Center this summer, showing up at 8 a.m. to work out. Maintaining a stable schedule, he says, is something that he’s learned from fellow frontcourt mates Aron Baynes and Al Horford, both of whom often show up to the practice facility at 6 a.m.“Just seeing that exact same repetition, that same consistency every day, I’ve learned a lot from them already,” Williams said. Williams has also made a solid impression on his teammates over the course of the summer. Baynes told Celtics.com Tuesday afternoon that he’s liked the work ethic he’s seen from the rookie so far.“He’s definitely got a few attributes that are going to help the team,” said Baynes. “And he’s definitely got an exciting future.”Building toward that bright future will be a process, but Williams is clearly ready to put in the work to make it happen.“You have to go through the boring days, as people call them,” said Williams. “You have to go through everything that you wouldn’t expect to go through to get where you want to be.”Although his first NBA offseason hasn’t gone completely as planned in regard to his health, Williams is still making the most out of the hand he’s been dealt. He’s developing a professional mindset and learning the ropes of the Celtics system, all while getting his body ready for his first NBA grind.“Injuries happen to everyone,” said Williams. “It’s just a minor setback, as my dad would call it, but just gotta give it 100 percent. Every day that you give 100 percent, you get closer and closer to being back on the court.”With that attitude, Williams should be cleared for 5-on-5 action in no time.
BOSTON – The Boston Celtics begin training camp later this month, so it’s time we break down the roster and provide an idea of what the team’s depth chart will look like heading into the 2018-19 Season.Rather than classifying the players with the traditional 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 positional tags, we are taking a page out of coach Brad Stevens’ book by placing each athlete into one of the following three roles.Last week, we analyzed the Celtics’ depth at the ball-handling position. Today, we continue our Roster Breakdown Series by highlighting Boston’s bigs. As their title indicates, these are the largest players on the floor and they’re responsible for banging bodies around in the post and protecting the rim.Here are the five players who will likely be sharing that job for the Celtics this season.Having the right type of leader can go a long way for a team fighting its way through the NBA Playoffs. Such was the case last season for Celtics, who relied heavily on veteran big man Al Horford to steer their young, inexperienced ship to success.With All-Stars Gordon Hayward and Kyrie Irving sidelined for the postseason, Horford was the guy that all of Boston’s young players looked toward for guidance. Coach Brad Stevens called him “the rock” of the team as it battled all the way to Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals.Horford’s role with the Celtics isn’t to rack up huge numbers – he averaged 12.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game last season, while shooting a career-high 42.9 percent from long range – but his communication, court vision and game management on both ends of the floor were what kept the Celtics glued together during times of hardship. Coaches around the league recognized Horford’s expertise in those areas and voted him into the 2018 All-Star Game as a reserve.The 31-year-old’s leadership on the defensive end is what should be cherished most by Celtics fans. His versatility and rim protection on that end helped to guide Boston to the best defensive rating in the league and earned him a spot on the All-Defensive Second Team.Hayward and Irving are set to return for the 2018-19 Season, but Horford’s role as a leader should in no way be diminished. He’ll be the rock of the frontcourt, as well as the cool, calm and collected presence that keeps all of his teammates on the same page throughout the upcoming campaign.Horford was the only Celtic who collected any defensive hardware last season, but his new starting frontcourt mate made just as much of an impact on that end of the floor.Aron Baynes was the brick wall of Boston’s league-leading defense, fearlessly taking on any opponent and contesting every shot attempted within his vicinity. The 6-foot-10 Australian center often flew under the radar, but his elite vertical awareness, lateral quickness and willingness to do the dirty work down low landed him the best individual defensive rating in the league among players who played at least half of the season.  During his first season in green, Baynes averaged 6.0 points and 5.4 rebounds per game while playing 18.3 minutes per contest. He was also Boston’s most durable player, seeing action in a team-high 81 games.Baynes entered free agency this summer knowing that his role would likely decrease if he remained with the Celtics due to the anticipated returns of Hayward and Irving. However, the veteran big man had developed a great sense of Celtic Pride over the past year and couldn’t see himself signing anywhere else.   Baynes told Celtics.com last week that he ultimately wanted to be with a team that could contend for a title. And in Boston, the defensive stalwart should be able to help the C’s do just that.Theis made a seamless transition from international hoops to the NBA, sliding into Boston’s rotation with ease. By the fourth game of the season, the 6-foot-9 rookie was already earning significant minutes and Coach Stevens was praising his energy on a near-nightly basis.The German native would wind up averaging 5.3 points and 4.3 rebounds per game, all while shooting a team-high 54.1 percent from the field. Many of his points came by way of dunks, as he often finds himself on the receiving end of an alley-oop pass.  In mid-March, Theis’ campaign came to an abrupt, heartbreaking end, as he tore his left meniscus during the final minute of a game against the Indiana Pacers. The injury called for season-ending surgery, but he is on track to be ready to go by the start of training camp.It’s hard not to love Guerschon Yabusele.  The French-born Dancing Bear has brought an infectious, vibrant attitude to Boston, and his potential on the court is just as bright.Yabusele saw limited action last season, appearing in just 33 games, but he brought phenomenal energy to Boston’s bench unit whenever he was on the floor. At 6-foot-8, 260 pounds, the forward boasts an imposing figure, but he’s also surprisingly agile for his size. He runs the floor well, has great strength and even has a solid 3-point shot, which is often followed by a celebratory bow-and-arrow dab.At just 22 years old, the international big man still has a lot of room for growth, but he’s shown great promise during his short tenure with the Celtics so far.The Celtics have needed a bona fide shot-blocker for years, and that’s exactly what they hauled in from the 2018 NBA Draft. Boston used its lone draft pick to select 20-year-old Robert Williams, an athletic, defensive specialist who uses his imposing, 7-foot-6 wingspan to wreak havoc around the rim.Williams spent two seasons at Texas A&M, where he earned back-to-back SEC Defensive Player of the Year honors while averaging 11.1 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.5 blocks per game.
BOSTON – Gordon Hayward proclaimed Thursday afternoon that he is “basically 100 percent” healthy and revealed that he has been playing 5-on-5 basketball for the last two weeks.Hayward, who suffered a season-ending left ankle injury on Opening Night of last season, said that he has not dealt with any mental hurdles on the court while recently participating in four 5-on-5 games at the Celtics' practice facility.“I haven’t had any fear as far as cutting or jumping, anything like that,” Hayward stated as he spoke to media members for the first time since Dec. 15, when Boston hosted his former team, the Utah Jazz. “I think it’s just working my way back into a groove, finding the different rhythms, the timings of the game.”The All-Star forward believes that his playing time over the last two weeks, combined with training camp and preseason play, will have him prepared to take the court for Opening Night on Oct. 16.“Yes,” he said in regard to playing in the first game of the season, “100 percent I expect to be out there.”Such certainty was not a guarantee after Hayward suffered a setback in May that required a second surgery.During his rehab, Hayward began to experience irritation on the outside of the injured ankle. It was determined in late-May that the hardware in the ankle – a plate and screws – needed to be removed. Successful surgery was performed May 30.That moment was just one of many that left Hayward questioning if, rather than when, he would ever return to the court at full strength.“I’ve told multiple people the hardest part of this whole process has been the mental challenge,” Hayward said. He later added, “Especially when it happens, there are definitely some dark days, days where you just don’t know if you’re going to be the same player. What’s on the horizon? What’s the future look like?”It was his family, his teammates, his coaches and his fans who helped him to battle through the darkest of times. He said that small gestures from all of those people helped him along the way, including one that stood out from teammate Aron Baynes.“I can remember Aron Baynes – I’m a big donut guy, I like donuts, that’s like my cheat food,” he admitted with a smile, “and I remember he brought Krispy Kremes back from a road trip and drove them over to the house. Just simple things like that mean a lot to me, means a lot to my family too, that people care.”Hayward now wants to pay Baynes and everyone else back by helping to push the Celtics back into the NBA Finals.Such is a lofty goal, but it’s one that is centered in the sights of Hayward and the C’s.“We’re worried about winning and putting another banner up behind you,” Hayward said in response to a question about the potential of him coming off the bench. “Like I said, we have so much depth, we have so much talent. It doesn’t matter who starts to me. My goal is to help us get that banner.”Accomplishing that goal would be a heck of a way to continue Hayward’s story, but just like during his rehab, Hayward won’t get caught up in long-term goals.The last year of his life has been all about short-term goals and step-by-step accomplishments. Nothing will change there.Within the last two weeks, Hayward was given full clearance to return to 5-on-5 basketball for the first time since Oct. 17. His next goal is to regain his rhythm and carry it into – and through – Opening Night.

BOSTON – Robert Williams won over the hearts of Boston Celtics fans Sunday night in his first career appearance at TD Garden by sealing a 115-112 preseason win over the Charlotte Hornets with a game-saving block. But it was the rookie’s action following the swat that won over the hearts of his teammates.With his Celtics on top 113-112 and with less than 20 seconds left to play, Williams switched out onto the perimeter to contest a potential game-winning 3-pointer by Hornets guard Malik Monk. Using all of his 7-foot-6 wingspan, Williams tipped the attempt, causing it to fall short of the basket and into the hands of fellow rookie Brad Wanamaker.The athletic defensive play brought Celtics fans to their feet, yet the most intriguing part of the sequence was still to come. Wanamaker took two dribbles and passed the ball off to Williams, who had a wide-open lane to the cup. However, instead of rewarding himself for the previous play with an emphatic dunk, the 6-foot-9 big man dished the rock off to Guerschon Yabusele, who laid in the final bucket of the game with ease.Most 20-year-old rookies in this type of situation would have soaked in the limelight and thrown the ball down with authority. Such was not the case for Williams on this occasion, and the unselfish decision caught the eye of his veteran teammates.“Those little things right there show you how well he fits in the mold of being a Boston Celtic,” said Kyrie Irving, who scored a team-high 20 points. “He makes the huge play and then passes to Guersch when he could’ve easily wind-milled or done something crazy for the crowd. But he passes to Guersch, we seal the game, and I know that felt good for him and for the rest of us.”It also felt good for Williams to be able to show off his versatility on the defensive end. His ability to switch out to the perimeter and defend a guard like he did on the last play is an invaluable trait to have, and one that he has been developing over the past year or so.“Toward the end of college, I started switching a little bit more, so I’m sort of used to it,” said Williams, who logged five points and a team-high plus-13 rating during 10 minutes of play. “It’s just something you’ve gotta be prepared to do. Coach (Brad Stevens) said that in a timeout, he told us, ‘Hey, 1 through 5, we’re switching now,’ so you’ve just gotta be mentally ready for something like that.”Mentally speaking, it appears as though Williams' mind has been in the right place through the first five days of the preseason. His coaches and teammates have all lauded his work ethic and believe it shows signs of him having a bright future in the NBA.“His effort level all the way through, everything he’s done since he’s been here, has been really good,” said Stevens. “I thought he got tired (Sunday night) and missed the opportunity to run the floor a couple of times, but he’s trying and we’re excited about the way he’s making progress. You can tell that there’s a lot there, potentially.” Celtics fans are beginning to see that potential for themselves in Williams’ great display of length and athleticism. Meanwhile, his teammates are beginning to appreciate how his mental makeup could help impact the organization heading forward. “You can see how long his arms are and how athletic he is as a young guy, but what has really interests me is how smart he is as a basketball player,” said Irving. “He just fits very well with our system.”That bond will only continue to grow as Williams takes on his rookie season. And based on the strong impressions he’s made during Week 1, it appears as though he’s on the right track.

But when Wedman played for the Celtics, the role of the three-point shot in the game of basketball was still evolving. Consider this: In 1985-86, the  Celtics collectively attempted 393 three-pointers; in 2002 they made 671.“The first year of the three-point shot, I think I only hit five or so of them, and I was considered an outside shooter!”, chuckled Wedman. “Of course, we started increasing the number we took, but not quite to the level they do today. I like it, though. It is not an easy shot and I think it makes the game exciting.”Wedman first played for the Kansas City Kings from 1974 through 1981, in which time he twice averaged as many as 19 points per game and was a two-time All-Star. After a brief stay in Cleveland, he was traded to Boston in January 1983 for Darren Tillis, a first-round pick and cash.When Wedman retired as a Celtic in 1987, he left Boston with two championship rings as well as the experience of being a cog in one of the greatest teams ever assembled. While he toyed with the idea of following many of his former Celtic teammates into the coaching profession, he soon realized he had his fill of travelling across country as a player.Now a resident of Missouri, Wedman continued a venture he first began as a player 25 years ago - his real estate company. In addition to managing and owning property, he has also joined a long-time friend in restoring classic and specialty automobiles.“I thought about (coaching),” said Wedman. “If Kansas City still had a team, I would have stayed involved. But after 13 years of traveling, I thought it would be best if I stayed at home. I do not have the most exciting life, I guess. But I am very happy.”Married to his wife, Kim, of 26 years, Wedman has never been able to ride himself of basketball completely. He still runs shooting camps for young players during the summer months, and did some college scouting a few years back. Mike D’Antoni, former Head Coach of the Nuggets, asked Wedman to look at some of the players in the mid-west area – especially ones that Denver might be interested in taking with their first pick in the 1998 Draft – the second overall selection.“He asked me to scout some local college games as they were preparing for the NBA Draft, which included some games in which I saw Kansas." said Wedman.  "Well, Denver ended up taking Raef Lafrentz. But I told him that Paul Pierce was one of the best players in the draft. He had a lot of maturity for a college player. He may score 20 one night, and only get four the next night, but those four might be the last four of the ball game. I really liked his attitude.”The old Celtics always have had an eye for talent, haven’t they?
SAN FRANCISCO – It is rare to get an invite to Google’s headquarters, so the Brooklyn Nets were more than excited to accept an guided tour from the tech giant.Several of Brooklyn's players and coaching staff members visited the Googleplex in Mountain View, California. Considering Google’s place as an industry leader – the company is valued at $800 billion – the players were eager to learn what is behind its success.Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was particularly moved by seeing how the employees at the company were always trying to find new ideas and inventions to launch. He believes there some similarities to how NBA players approach improving their games.“You see how much people just want to be a part of their program, their organization,” he explained to BrooklynNets.com. “Just the best thinkers in the world are in that area, it’s great to see.“It’s interesting because if you look at it, they don’t physically work as hard as us – we can say the same, we don’t work mentally as hard as them – but in the end of the day, they are thinking of ways to be innovative, you can make the same statement for basketball players.”For Hollis-Jefferson, who is still learning in his third year in the league, he wants to emulate some of that thought process.“[NBA players are] people who aren’t just comfortable with being average,” Hollis-Jefferson said. “They have to be innovative, they have to find ways to stand out from the group.“That’s something that I take from life in general and people that I’m around; How can I be different? How can I be innovative? That’s why I try to impact the game in so many different ways, to make it like ‘Wow, Rondae pretty much does it all.’”Jarrett Allen, a self-noted tech junkie, also appreciated having an opportunity to learn a little bit about how Google operates.“Seeing one of the headquarters of one of the biggest online resources in the world – it’s like a one-of-a-kind opportunity,” Allen told BrookylnNets.com.Both men also revealed that they are interested in pursuing opportunities in the tech industry as well.“As [things] advance, there will be a lot of growth,” Allen said. “Something down the line, whatever it is, I’ll be into it." NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

Rodions Kurucs began playing basketball at the age of five with a group of seven-year-olds. Why not with youngsters his own age? Because there was no organized basketball for five-year-olds in Cesis, the Latvian town of fewer than 20,000 people in which he grew up.Why not wait until he was seven? Not an option. Not with his grandfather, Vladimirs Kiselovs, a basketball lifer and venerated coach in Latvia."He had two sons that they finished their careers very fast," said Kurucs. "He wanted us to succeed. So he said, 'you'll be a basketball player.' We didn't have any choice. But we loved it."The "we" includes younger brother Arturs, who also played two years up for his entire childhood, because that was the age difference between he and Rodions.For eight years, the trio was a unit. His grandfather, who came of age in the time of Soviet domination of the region, could be a hard-driving coach."I mean, we had a lot of fights," said Kurucs. "A lot of tears. That was crazy. I still remember all those times now. He was working with me and with my brother. He worked more with me, but my brother always was behind me and trying to do the things I do. I maybe had more talent, but he worked, he had a lot to prove. He proved a lot with his work that he put in the game."Away from the gym they bonded watching games. FC Barcelona was a favorite, mostly because of star guard Juan Carlos Navarro. But their preference was CSKA Moscow, which featured a sharpshooting American whom Kurucs came to idolize, former Duke star Trajan Langdon. Langdon is now Brooklyn's assistant general manager and when Kurucs came to Brooklyn for this year's NBA Draft, he was intent on getting a photo taken with Langdon -- even before the Nets took him with the 40th overall pick.By the time he was 13, it was time for bigger things. On his own, he moved to Latvia's capital, Riga, to play for the youth academy of the city's professional club. He shared an apartment with two others, and learned to take care of himself."Almost every night I was calling my mom to take me back," said Kurucs. "She said if you want I'll come and take you back, there's no problem. But then my grandfather would say to me, 'do you really want to come back or will you push through that and you'll get what you want.' I said, 'all right I will stay here and work'. But still every night, he said to me the same words every night."It was tough. School was tough. In Cesis, everyone knows my grandfather and school was much easier. They give me some bonuses and good grades. When I got there nobody cared about it, who's your grandfather, who I am. I had to study more. I had to take care of myself, food, how to get to the school on the metro and buses. That was tough. I was 13. I had to mature faster."By the time he was 16, he had moved up to Riga's squad in the top division of the country's professional loop, the Latvian Basketball League. Once upon a time, that was at the top of his grandfather's ambition for him. By then, they knew there was more to come. Four years later, he's about to embark on his first NBA season."It's actually a funny story. I just talked with my grandfather about it three days ago I think," said Kurucs. "We never thought that I would go that high actually. I asked him one day when I was younger, 'what do you want? Where do you want me to go? How high?' He said that it would be great if you played in the top Latvian league. I said, 'OK, that's good.' Then after the Latvian team I showed off my skills in a next generation tournament and Barcelona saw me and signed me. He was really happy for that. Who would imagine that I would go that high? Now I'm here, he's like, 'I don't have the words. I didn't even imagine that you could go that high.' I was going for that. That was my dream. That was my passion. I wanted to get here and to work here."NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

SAN FRANCISCO – It is rare to get an invite to Google’s headquarters, so the Brooklyn Nets were more than excited to accept an guided tour from the tech giant.Several of Brooklyn's players and coaching staff members visited the Googleplex in Mountain View, California. Considering Google’s place as an industry leader – the company is valued at $800 billion – the players were eager to learn what is behind its success.Rondae Hollis-Jefferson was particularly moved by seeing how the employees at the company were always trying to find new ideas and inventions to launch. He believes there some similarities to how NBA players approach improving their games.“You see how much people just want to be a part of their program, their organization,” he explained to BrooklynNets.com. “Just the best thinkers in the world are in that area, it’s great to see.“It’s interesting because if you look at it, they don’t physically work as hard as us – we can say the same, we don’t work mentally as hard as them – but in the end of the day, they are thinking of ways to be innovative, you can make the same statement for basketball players.”For Hollis-Jefferson, who is still learning in his third year in the league, he wants to emulate some of that thought process.“[NBA players are] people who aren’t just comfortable with being average,” Hollis-Jefferson said. “They have to be innovative, they have to find ways to stand out from the group.“That’s something that I take from life in general and people that I’m around; How can I be different? How can I be innovative? That’s why I try to impact the game in so many different ways, to make it like ‘Wow, Rondae pretty much does it all.’”Jarrett Allen, a self-noted tech junkie, also appreciated having an opportunity to learn a little bit about how Google operates.“Seeing one of the headquarters of one of the biggest online resources in the world – it’s like a one-of-a-kind opportunity,” Allen told BrookylnNets.com.Both men also revealed that they are interested in pursuing opportunities in the tech industry as well.“As [things] advance, there will be a lot of growth,” Allen said. “Something down the line, whatever it is, I’ll be into it." NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

It’s a crystal-clear December morning in South Florida. The sun is shining, very few clouds are in the sky and the temperature is in the mid-60s. A small taste of winter. And on this particular Saturday three days before Christmas, plenty of people are making their way to a local Walmart for last minute gifts. But perhaps nobody is happier than Randall Heidelburg. Why? Well, because when Udonis Haslem has something to say, you listen. With the help of his foundation, UD surprised Heidelburg and the students from the Expressive Arts magnet program at Charles R. Drew K-8 Center with a full-day excursion. After taking the students on a shopping spree and being generous with his time to others around the store, Haslem had a special gift for Heidelburg.

Ada, MichiganPerhaps best known as an inspiring, motivational leader and pioneer of the famous Amway direct selling method that offered individuals the opportunity to build businesses of their own, Mr. DeVos also was senior chairman of the Orlando Magic NBA franchise and a generous philanthropist with his late wife, Helen.A recipient of the Horatio Alger Award, Mr. DeVos’s life embodied the American dream of humble beginnings turned to great success through determined effort. He was born March 4, 1926, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and grew up during the Great Depression. He credited his interest in owning a business to his father, who always encouraged his son to go into business for himself.His entrepreneurial spirit took root in a high school friendship with classmate Jay Van Andel. The pair first dreamed of owning their own business while students at Grand Rapids Christian High School. Their friendship grew out of a business arrangement — Rich paid Jay 25 cents a week for rides to and from school in Jay’s 1931 Model A Ford.After both returned from service overseas in World War II, their early entrepreneurial ventures included a flight school and one of the first drive-in restaurants in Michigan. They sold both interests in 1948 to buy a sailboat in Connecticut with intentions to sail to the Caribbean — even though neither had any sailing experience. Their old wooden schooner, “Elizabeth,” sank off the coast of Cuba. A passing freighter rescued them, and they continued their adventure on land through South America.In 1949 they invested $49 and became highly successful independent distributors for Nutrilite, a manufacturer and direct seller of vitamins. The California manufacturer of vitamins used a person-to-person selling approach that the partners later adopted when starting Amway from their homes in Ada, Michigan, in 1959, with an all-purpose cleaner, L.O.C., as their only product. Their refined direct selling approach offered individuals around the world a business ownership opportunity.  After the first year of business, they moved to an abandoned service station located at Amway’s current headquarters site in Ada, Michigan. Over five decades, they built their business into a multi-billion dollar international corporation and the world’s leading direct selling company.Mr. DeVos was Amway president from the company’s founding until 1993, when he was succeeded by his son, Dick, and in 2002 by his son, Doug. Continuing in their fathers’ tradition, today Doug DeVos shares the Office of the Chief Executive with Chairman Steve Van Andel, son of co-founder Jay Van Andel. Rich DeVos remained active as a member of Amway’s Board of Directors until his death. Jay Van Andel died in December 2004.“Rich and my father built this company from the ground up, and in many ways, Rich was the heart and soul of Amway,” said Amway Chairman Steve Van Andel. “His vision and spirit inspired our employees and independent business owners for more than 50 years. No one even comes close to Rich in the love he inspired in the hearts and minds of our family of employees and business owners. We will miss him terribly.”An award-winning, inspirational speaker, he motivated hundreds of thousands of independent business owners worldwide and kept a full schedule of speaking engagements for a variety of business and charitable organizations across the country. A self-proclaimed “cheerleader,” he promoted the values of freedom, family, faith and philanthropy in books plus thousands of speeches and interviews around the world. As a reflection of his strong Christian faith, he was known for introducing himself at speaking engagements as “just a sinner saved by grace.”Mr. DeVos wrote five books: BELIEVE! (1975), Compassionate Capitalism (1993), Hope From My Heart (2000), Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive People (2008), and Simply Rich (2014). Simply Rich is a memoir reflecting on his work, faith, family, and the core values he held onto from his humble, Christian upbringing through his success as co-founder of Amway. Orlando MagicThe DeVos family purchased the Orlando Magic in September 1991. The Magic’s mission is to be world champions on and off the court, delivering legendary moments every step of the way. The Magic have won five division championships (1995, 1996, 2008, 2009, 2010) and had seven 50-plus win seasons, while capturing the Eastern Conference title in 1995 and 2009. In 2016, Mr. DeVos was inducted into the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame. “Mr. DeVos' boundless generosity, inspirational leadership and infectious enthusiasm will always be remembered. Simply, he was the team's No. 1 cheerleader and the best owner that a Magic fan could ever want for their team. When the DeVos Family purchased the Magic, his vision was that the team and organization would serve as a platform to improve the Central Florida community. That legacy will certainly live on, both in the Orlando Magic's community efforts and philanthropic contributions, as well as in the way we strive to play the game with passion, a strong work ethic and integrity, while also bringing people together from all walks of life,” said Alex Martins, Chief Executive Officer, Orlando Magic. A Legacy of PhilanthropyAnnually ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the world’s billionaires, Mr. DeVos shared his success as a philanthropist and community leader. Mr. DeVos volunteered his time and leadership to a number of causes and with his late wife, Helen, donated generously through the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation.In the 1970s, as chairman of the New Grand Rapids Committee, Mr. DeVos was instrumental in the revitalization of downtown Grand Rapids, including the construction of the DeVos Performance Hall. He and Jay Van Andel led the restoration of the former Pantlind Hotel, which was purchased by Amway and is now the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. Mr. DeVos and Mr. Van Andel also spearheaded the Amway-owned JW Marriott Hotel.Mr. DeVos and his late wife supported many other community projects, such as DeVos Place Convention Center and the Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital.The couple also supported Christian education including Rehoboth and Zuni Christian Schools in New Mexico that have been providing opportunities for Native American children for more than 100 years. Others include the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Arts and Worship at Grand Rapids Christian High School, the DeVos Communications Center at Calvin College and the Helen DeVos College of Education at Lee University. They were generous supporters to other higher education institutions including The King’s College in New York City, Grand Valley State University, Northwood University, Michigan State University – College of Human Medicine, and Hope College.They were long-time residents of Central Florida and supported numerous civic, educational and religious organizations there. The Orlando Magic supports the local community through sponsorships of events, donated tickets, autographed merchandise, and grants. In addition, over the last 28 years, various local nonprofit community organizations have received support through the Orlando Magic Youth Foundation which serves at-risk youth and has impacted more than one million children.  Orlando Magic community relations programs annually impact an estimated 100,000 kids each year, while the Magic Volunteer Program (MVP), an organizational staff-wide initiative, provides more than 7,000 community volunteer hours annually.They also contributed to national organizations such as the National Constitution Center and the National Organization on Disability.In 2006, Rich and the late Helen DeVos were honored with The Philanthropy Roundtable William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership. In 2010 they were awarded the Clare Boothe Luce Award by the Heritage Foundation and in 2012 they received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Direct Selling Association.

Washington, D.C.  - Monumental Sports and Entertainment (MSE) and Capital One today announced that Capital One will become the new naming rights partner for the arena in downtown Washington, which hosts over 220 concerts, shows and events a year, including the Washington Capitals, Washington Mystics, Washington Valor, Washington Wizards and Georgetown men's basketball. The partnership of these two prominent local companies underscores their deep commitment to the continued economic growth and development of Washington, D.C. where they are both headquartered, and where Monumental employs 4,000 full and part-time employees and vendors. It also reinforces the unique position that Washington, D.C. holds and the role the D.C. market plays as a center for global influence and a platform for business-to-business and business-to-government connections, offering opportunities that can't be replicated anywhere else. The arena will be called Capital One Arena beginning immediately, with the full signage and branding shift to occur in fall 2017."Capital One is one of the most influential local businesses in our region over the last two decades, so we couldn't be more pleased to partner with another homegrown company to create more incredible memories for sports fans, music fans, families and friends all across our region," said Ted Leonsis, Founder, Majority Owner and CEO of Monumental Sports and Entertainment. "Capital One shares our deep commitment to both economic and philanthropic investment in the larger Washington, D.C. community and we look forward to working closely with them. We are also proud today to be announcing a significant investment by Monumental Sports and Entertainment to continue improving the arena experience for every fan who comes through our doors. We want every fan's experience at Capital One Arena to be monumental.""As a top local employer and major consumer brand, Capital One has deep roots in Washington, D.C. and we are excited to strengthen our contributions to the sports and entertainment landscape in our own backyard," said Kleber Santos, President, Retail and Direct Banking, Capital One. "Monumental Sports and Entertainment shares our commitment to strengthening the economic and social well-being of the local community, and we are thrilled to partner with them on Capital One Arena. Our collaboration will be great for the D.C. community, the fans who come to support their teams, the talent and events at the arena, and exceptional for our customers who will benefit from our ability to offer access to unique opportunities and experiences at the arena that money can't buy.""Capital One Arena is the premiere destination for sports and entertainment in the greater Washington region from Richmond to Baltimore and we have some of the biggest tours and events in the world coming through our doors over the next year," said Jim Van Stone, President, Business Operations, Monumental Sports and Entertainment. "Our partnership with Capital One is a reminder that Washington, D.C. is one of the most dynamic and attractive markets to do business in the country, offering a platform for global influence that can't be matched by any other market in the US."As part of its continued commitment to provide the best fan experience in the country, Monumental Sports and Entertainment today also announces a separate, independent $40 million investment in Capital One Arena. Capital One Arena is one of the few privately-owned arenas in the country, and throughout its ownership, MSE has made over $100 million in investments to ensure the arena remains a best-in-class facility. The announcement today of this new investment is a further down payment on that commitment. This partnership is also the joining of two companies who count philanthropic investment and community work as one of their core corporate values. The Monumental Sports and Entertainment Foundation donated more than $775,000 to local charities during the 2016-2017 season. Players, coaches and their spouses, along with MSE front office staff and fans, volunteered time and money throughout the Washington, D.C. community through our programming and charitable partners. MSE adopted 34 local families for the holidays, providing them with clothing, electronics, toys, books and gift cards. MSE staff alone volunteered more than 1,100 hours during the 2016-2017 season with partnering organizations D.C. Central Kitchen, Capital Area Food Bank, Everybody Wins! DC, Martha's Table, Fort Dupont, Playworks DC and Anacostia Waterfront Trust. Capital One shares MSE's commitment and the belief that our businesses can be successful only when our local communities are healthy and vibrant. In 2016, Capital One associates spent more than 390,000 hours in volunteer service, helping more than 4,000 nonprofit and community agencies in the Greater Washington area. Capital One also provided $48.1 million in grants to nonprofit organizations that help build economic opportunity in communities where our associates and customers live and work.As part of its independent investment announced today, MSE will continue to push the envelope by employing cutting edge technology to benefit our fans. For example, through the Monumental360 program, MSE will use data to build out a full view of our fans, so we can better cater to their individual needs and interests. Our aim is to use what fans tell us about their preferences when they interact with any touch point of a Monumental franchise. Who they follow on social media, channel of purchase and seat location, how they connect to arena WIFI and what they purchase in the arena can help us tailor not just the Capital One Arena experience, but their fan experience outside the building, too. We want to know our fans well - so we can make sure we are providing them with the very best experience.This summer, MSE also plans to move to a new point of sale system -- which will be a great first step toward faster lines and additional payment options for fans, as well as better analytics and data that will allow MSE to better tailor the arena experience to each fan. The new point of sale system will also enable MSE to offer Capital One cardholders automated discounts on food, beverage, merchandise and more.This is all part of MSE's continued commitment to ensure that Capital One Arena remains a premiere destination in the country for sports and entertainment. In 2016, Billboard Magazine ranked the arena 8th in the nation and 13th worldwide among top-grossing venues with a capacity of over 15,000. According to reports from the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, the arena has been responsible for redevelopment estimated at $9.2 billion within a seven- block radius, and has created more than 58,407 jobs since it broke ground in October 1995.In the coming months, Capital One Arena will host some of the biggest tours in the world including Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Guns n' Roses, Andrea Boccelli, Jay-Z and many more. It will also host the A-10 men's basketball tournament in March of 2018 and the East regionals of the 2019 NCAA men's basketball tournament.NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

September 15, 2017 – The Charlotte Hornets tonight unveiled their purple Statement Edition uniforms for the 2017-18 season at the Nike Innovation Summit in Culver City, California.  Like the previously released white Association, teal Icon and Classic Editions, the uniform features the logo of Nike’s Jordan Brand.  The Statement Edition is the fourth of five uniforms that will comprise the Uniform Collection worn this season by the Hornets, who are the only team in U.S. professional sports to have the iconic Jumpman logo on its uniforms.“We are pleased to share with our fans the fourth piece of our Hornets Uniform Collection for the 2017-18 season,” said Hornets President & COO Fred Whitfield.  “We look forward to seeing our players wearing these new uniforms as they represent our team, our city and our owner on the court.”Along with the addition of the Jordan Brand logo, the primary change fans will notice from the previous purple uniforms are that the word “Charlotte” now appears on the chest of the jersey and the tone-on-tone lettering on the shorts says “Hornets,” reversing the prior design.The third of four core team uniforms, the Statement Edition is inspired by teams’ desire to make a bold statement the moment they step on the court. Nike’s designers worked with the teams and the brand’s roster of athletes to create new and updated uniforms for this third edition.The Statement Edition uniform follows the earlier unveiling of the Association and Icon Edition uniforms. As previously announced, the home teams will determine which uniforms to wear at their games. The fourth team edition will be released later this year.Like the other new uniforms, the Statement Edition uniform is built on a refined version of the Nike Aeroswift basketball chassis.  The new chassis includes modifications to the armholes, back shoulder, seams and hemlines, as well as a material that remove moisture 30-percent faster than previous NBA uniforms. The Statement jersey is expected to be available at retail in late November.NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

The California manufacturer of vitamins used a person-to-person selling approach that the partners later adopted when starting Amway from their homes in Ada, Michigan, in 1959, with an all-purpose cleaner, L.O.C., as their only product. Their refined direct selling approach offered individuals around the world a business ownership opportunity.  After the first year of business, they moved to an abandoned service station located at Amway’s current headquarters site in Ada, Michigan. Over five decades, they built their business into a multi-billion dollar international corporation and the world’s leading direct selling company.Mr. DeVos was Amway president from the company’s founding until 1993, when he was succeeded by his son, Dick, and in 2002 by his son, Doug. Continuing in their fathers’ tradition, today Doug DeVos shares the Office of the Chief Executive with Chairman Steve Van Andel, son of co-founder Jay Van Andel. Rich DeVos remained active as a member of Amway’s Board of Directors until his death. Jay Van Andel died in December 2004.“Rich and my father built this company from the ground up, and in many ways, Rich was the heart and soul of Amway,” said Amway Chairman Steve Van Andel. “His vision and spirit inspired our employees and independent business owners for more than 50 years. No one even comes close to Rich in the love he inspired in the hearts and minds of our family of employees and business owners. We will miss him terribly.”An award-winning, inspirational speaker, he motivated hundreds of thousands of independent business owners worldwide and kept a full schedule of speaking engagements for a variety of business and charitable organizations across the country. A self-proclaimed “cheerleader,” he promoted the values of freedom, family, faith and philanthropy in books plus thousands of speeches and interviews around the world. As a reflection of his strong Christian faith, he was known for introducing himself at speaking engagements as “just a sinner saved by grace.”Mr. DeVos wrote five books: BELIEVE! (1975), Compassionate Capitalism (1993), Hope From My Heart (2000), Ten Powerful Phrases for Positive People (2008), and Simply Rich (2014). Simply Rich is a memoir reflecting on his work, faith, family, and the core values he held onto from his humble, Christian upbringing through his success as co-founder of Amway. Orlando MagicThe DeVos family purchased the Orlando Magic in September 1991. The Magic’s mission is to be world champions on and off the court, delivering legendary moments every step of the way. The Magic have won five division championships (1995, 1996, 2008, 2009, 2010) and had seven 50-plus win seasons, while capturing the Eastern Conference title in 1995 and 2009. In 2016, Mr. DeVos was inducted into the Orlando Magic Hall of Fame. “Mr. DeVos' boundless generosity, inspirational leadership and infectious enthusiasm will always be remembered. Simply, he was the team's No. 1 cheerleader and the best owner that a Magic fan could ever want for their team. When the DeVos Family purchased the Magic, his vision was that the team and organization would serve as a platform to improve the Central Florida community. That legacy will certainly live on, both in the Orlando Magic's community efforts and philanthropic contributions, as well as in the way we strive to play the game with passion, a strong work ethic and integrity, while also bringing people together from all walks of life,” said Alex Martins, Chief Executive Officer, Orlando Magic. A Legacy of PhilanthropyAnnually ranked by Forbes magazine as one of the world’s billionaires, Mr. DeVos shared his success as a philanthropist and community leader. Mr. DeVos volunteered his time and leadership to a number of causes and with his late wife, Helen, donated generously through the Richard and Helen DeVos Foundation.In the 1970s, as chairman of the New Grand Rapids Committee, Mr. DeVos was instrumental in the revitalization of downtown Grand Rapids, including the construction of the DeVos Performance Hall. He and Jay Van Andel led the restoration of the former Pantlind Hotel, which was purchased by Amway and is now the Amway Grand Plaza Hotel. Mr. DeVos and Mr. Van Andel also spearheaded the Amway-owned JW Marriott Hotel.Mr. DeVos and his late wife supported many other community projects, such as DeVos Place Convention Center and the Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital.The couple also supported Christian education including Rehoboth and Zuni Christian Schools in New Mexico that have been providing opportunities for Native American children for more than 100 years. Others include the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Arts and Worship at Grand Rapids Christian High School, the DeVos Communications Center at Calvin College and the Helen DeVos College of Education at Lee University. They were generous supporters to other higher education institutions including The King’s College in New York City, Grand Valley State University, Northwood University, Michigan State University – College of Human Medicine, and Hope College.They were long-time residents of Central Florida and supported numerous civic, educational and religious organizations there. The Orlando Magic supports the local community through sponsorships of events, donated tickets, autographed merchandise, and grants. In addition, over the last 28 years, various local nonprofit community organizations have received support through the Orlando Magic Youth Foundation which serves at-risk youth and has impacted more than one million children.  Orlando Magic community relations programs annually impact an estimated 100,000 kids each year, while the Magic Volunteer Program (MVP), an organizational staff-wide initiative, provides more than 7,000 community volunteer hours annually.They also contributed to national organizations such as the National Constitution Center and the National Organization on Disability.In 2006, Rich and the late Helen DeVos were honored with The Philanthropy Roundtable William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership. In 2010 they were awarded the Clare Boothe Luce Award by the Heritage Foundation and in 2012 they received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Direct Selling Association.

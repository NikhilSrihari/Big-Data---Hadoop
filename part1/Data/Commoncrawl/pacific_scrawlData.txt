After being selected 11th and 13th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft, Clippers rookie guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jerome Robinson made their mark in their first foray into professional basketball during the team’s entry in the 2018 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas.“I think for the most part, we were able to show that Jerome and Shai are players. And they’re going to be a lot of fun for us to work with and continue to develop and grow,” said Casey Hill, head coach of the Clippers’ Summer League team. “Their foundation is very solid. It’s going to be a lot of fun to build on.”Gilgeous-Alexander turned heads while putting his full array of skills on display, showing a proclivity for getting into the paint and not only scoring effectively at the rim and in the mid-range, but also setting up his teammates for easy looks. He is a natural distributor with a handle rarely seen of young guards. As a defender, Gilgeous-Alexander’s 6’6” frame and nearly 7-foot wingspan allow him to disrupt passing lanes and force deflections and turnovers. His high basketball IQ and physical tools often lead him to the right spots on both sides of the ball and in position to make an impact on the game.Starting each of his four games, Gilgeous-Alexander is the first player in Las Vegas Summer League history to average at least 19 points, four assists and two steals across a minimum of three appearances, despite playing just 27.8 minutes per contest. In the team’s two wins against Sacramento and Washington, he averaged 19.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.0 steals and shot 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from downtown.“I feel like I’m getting better each game and that’s all I really wanted to get out of Summer League. [I wanted to] get more comfortable and just get more adjusted to the plays now,” said Gilgeous-Alexander after last Wednesday’s win over the Wizards. “Obviously the real league is going to be a little bit different, but the same thing goes for that, just get better every game.”A rangy 6’5” guard, Robinson showed off a skill-set reminiscent of other sharpshooting, instant-offense sparkplugs that have been successful in the NBA in recent years. He is a confident jump-shooter, unafraid to attack defenders eager to close him out behind the arc with either a step-back or strong drive to the basket. His strong court vision affords him the ability to create for his teammates and see the floor as plays develop.Despite missing three games for rest, Robinson started each of the three games in which he appeared, averaging 13.7 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.7 assists in just under 24 minutes, and connected on at least two three-point attempts in each game.Robinson’s biggest takeaways arguably came off the court, in conversations with head coach Doc Rivers and team consultant Jerry West. “It is great to have those guys in your corner, being able to grab their experiences and their knowledge and applying it to my game as best as possible,” said Robinson. “It is a great experience. There are things for us to hone-in and work on. I am sure we will have more [discussions] than just the short time we had here.”Although Summer League was just the first pit stop for these promising young prospects, both Gilgeous-Alexander and Robinson seized the opportunity to demonstrate the character, work ethic and skill-set that convinced the Clippers’ front office to select them as lottery picks in last month’s draft. With training camp opening in just over two months, fans can look forward to following the duo as they begin their rookie seasons and launch their NBA careers.


Current Clippers Assistant Coach Kim Hughes will immediately assume the role of Interim Head Coach, and will retain the position through the remainder of the 09-10 season.Your browser does not support iframes.In defining the move, Dunleavy said, Ive had several conversations with our owner (Donald T. Sterling) concerning what we think is best for the team overall. We have discussed the possibility of my concentrating only on Basketball Operations. That option has always been available to me.Dunleavy continued, Ive come to the conclusion that this is the ideal time for me to direct my efforts toward the many personnel opportunities that lie before us, such as the trade market, the Draft and the free agent process. We fully expect to be active and productive on all those fronts.Roeser stated, We fully agree with Mike that this is the right time to make this change. It just seems clear that the team needs a fresh voice and we hope that our players will respond in a positive way. As we approach the trade deadline, the NBA Draft and the upcoming Free Agent period, our team is very well-positioned from a salary cap standpoint.  Mikes experienced input will be vitally important as we continue to develop our young talented nucleus and shape our teams future.The Clippers all-time franchise leader in wins with 215, Dunleavy has coached the 15th most games in NBA history (1,329) and became the 21st coach in NBA history to win 600 career games on Nov. 29, 2009.

NEW ORLEANS – Glen “Big Baby” Davis had only been with the Clippers for a few minutes Monday morning, but even then it was clear how much he could help them in their drive toward the Playoffs.Davis, who mutually agreed to a contract buyout with the Orlando Magic on Friday, signed with the Clippers after clearing waivers. He joined the team in New Orleans for the final game of their three-game road trip and took part in the morning meeting to prepare for the Pelicans, eating breakfast with his new teammates. He will wear jersey No. 12 on Monday and likely switch to No. 0, his number at LSU, when the team returns home.“It really hasn’t hit me yet,” Davis said. “It really hasn’t dawned on me. Everything’s happened so fast. Today was my first day of just really eating breakfast with the guys. It’s my first experience of bringing back old memories, especially with Doc [Rivers] and Armond Hill and [Tyronn Lue] and Kevin Eastman. They’re a great group of guys and I won a championship with them, so we have a bond.” Davis, 28, played the first four seasons of his career in Boston with Rivers and a number of the Clippers assistants that he named. He won a title in 2008 as a rookie and was an integral part of the team’s run to the Finals in 2010.He’s appeared in 69 postseason games, including five with the Magic two seasons ago. He started 14 games for the Celtics in the 2009 Playoffs place of Kevin Garnett (knee), averaging 15.8 points, 5.6 rebounds and shooting 49.1 percent from the floor. He hit the biggest shot of the postseason as well, nailing a jumper off a pick-and-roll feed from Paul Pierce at the buzzer to give Boston a 95-94 victory over Orlando in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals.Getting back to the postseason after missing out in 2012-13 and having a chance to win a second title is something that weighed heavily in Davis’ decision to join the Clippers (38-20) instead of other potential suitors.“I’ve always made the Playoffs in my career and not playing for something was crazy,” Davis said. “Being on this team is some fresh energy, knowing that you can help a team win a championship is important. It feels good.”And he should make an impact right away. He knows Rivers’ system. He is a willing and rugged post defender, and while Davis is not ideal in terms of height, he has the rebounding ability and toughness to play center or power forward.“It gives us another big,” Rivers said. “What I like about a guy like that is he can play the 5 or the 4. He knows my system.”He could be valuable as a pick-and-pop player with Chris Paul, playing alongside Blake Griffin or DeAndre Jordan. He also can provide offensive balance. In 2010-11, Davis scored 22.4 percent of his points in spot up situations and 22.1 percent on post ups, according to Synergy Sports.“It’s awesome, especially for me being a guy who sets screens and gets guys open,” Davis said of Paul. “He finds them. That is just awesome. It makes it so much easier for me, having a guy who can find me. It kind of gives me an advantage.”In Davis’ final season with the Celtics he shot 36.1 percent from 16-24 feet, taking 321 field goals from that distance. Davis was most deadly that season from 10-14 feet, shooting 45.2 percent."With us [in Boston], we had Perk [Kendrick Perkins] and we had Kevin Garnett [inside]," Rivers said when the Clippers visited Orlando in November. "We needed a guy to stretch the floor. And so we really worked with him [Davis] and asked him to do that. He did that for the good of the team and it was important for us."Of course, Davis also provides an emotional lift.“He always plays hard,” Jamal Crawford said. “He wears his emotions on his sleeve. Obviously, being with Doc before helps. There is not an adjustment there. He knows what to expect every single night.“There are things he’ll be able to tell, being with Doc before. He’ll be like, ‘No, no, you can go that way or that way.’ I think that could help tremendously.”Davis agreed.“What Doc wants is for you to play hard and play the right way, give yourself up for the next guy,” Davis said. “That was embedded in my brain as a rookie and my four years playing with him. That’s just a part of my game. The think he noticed it and asked me to come along.”



On Sunday, January 13th Clippers' center Chris Kaman revealed on ESPN's "Outside the Lines" that as a child he was misdiagnosed with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Kaman learned from Dr. Tim Royer that he does not have ADHD, but rather what Royer calls "an anxious brain." Kaman's brain was working too fast, not too slow as implied by his previous ADHD diagnosis.The Clippers center has been working with Royer and Neurofeedback technology since last July. The technology requires Kaman to sit in front a computer screen that monitors his brain waves. This exercise helps him learn how to regulate his brain waves so that he can focus, which he attributes to the career season he's having.My uncle, who I really admire and I trust his opinion, gave me Dr. Royers number. We met, and I didnt really get it at first, but once I figured out how it worked, I liked it and wanted to try it.Now thinking back, Im in a position now where Im able to help people who were like me when I was younger. I wouldnt change the past because of where Im at now  Im really blessed.Were working with schools all over the country to get kids into the program. We can help them with test scores, IQ scores and grade point averages. Its benefited a lot of kids, so I thought I needed to get involved.

The USA Basketball Mens National Team program has come a long way as the elite list of players who are now part of our program shows. The selected finalists are a very, very talented group; the depth of the talent is extraordinary. This selection decision was as difficult of a challenge as Ive faced since I took on the USA National Team program in 2005, said Colangelo, who has served as the managing director of the USA Mens National Team since 2005. I feel like we have an outstanding blend of talents from the 2008 Olympic and 2010 World Championship teams that won gold. Reducing to the official roster limit of 12 players will be an even tougher decision, but well evaluate how guys play during the 2011-12 NBA season and as weve done with our teams in the past, well attempt to select the very best team we can.Jerry has built an extremely deep and talented USA National Team roster of 35 players and I want to thank each player for their incredible commitment to being part of USA Basketball. Reducing to 20 players was unbelievably difficult, stated Krzyzewski, who has coached USA National Teams to a sterling 48-1 record since 2006.Aside from the obvious special basketball talents that all of these players possess, what struck me most about the finalists was their commitment to USA Basketball and the international basketball experience they have compiled. Among our 20 finalists, we have two players who possess 55 or more games of international experience, two with 40 or more international games under their belts and eight others who have played between 23 and 38 international games  thats a lot of experience, which is going to be extremely valuable. These players have helped restore the winning tradition of USA Basketball while also gaining the respect of people around the world for the manner in which they have done it, added Krzyzewski.Three of the finalists are two-time Olympic medalists, including Anthony (2004 bronze and 2008 gold), James (2004 bronze and 2008 gold) and Wade (2004 bronze and 2008 gold).  Eight of the selected finalists were members of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team that compiled an unblemished record of 8-0 and captured gold in Beijing, including Anthony, Bosh, Bryant, Howard, James, Paul, Wade and Williams. Four finalists  Anthony, James, Odom and Wade - were part of the 2004 U.S. Olympic team that earned the bronze medal.Ten finalists were members of the 2010 USA World Championship squad that went 9-0 and captured gold in Istanbul, Turkey. Billups, Chandler, World Championship MVP Durant, Gay, Gordon, Iguodala, Love, Odom, Rose and Westbrook were all members of the USA World Championship Team.The finalists represent 14 different NBA teams, with the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Clippers leading the way with three players each; while the New York Knicks and Oklahoma City Thunder each have two players among the 20; and the Chicago Bulls, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, New Jersey Nets, New Orleans Hornets, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers and Portland Trail Blazers each are represented by one player.Eighteen of the finalists possess impressive international experience with Anthony leading the way with 59 games of international experience. He is followed by James (55), Williams (47), Wade (40), Howard (38), Paul (37), Bosh (32), Billups (30), Odom (28), Chandler (25), Bryant (24), Gay (23), Durant (17), Iguodala (16), Rose (16), Gordon (15), Love (15) and Westbrook (15).

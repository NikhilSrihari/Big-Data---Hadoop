After being selected 11th and 13th overall in the 2018 NBA Draft, Clippers rookie guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jerome Robinson made their mark in their first foray into professional basketball during the team’s entry in the 2018 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas.“I think for the most part, we were able to show that Jerome and Shai are players. And they’re going to be a lot of fun for us to work with and continue to develop and grow,” said Casey Hill, head coach of the Clippers’ Summer League team. “Their foundation is very solid. It’s going to be a lot of fun to build on.”Gilgeous-Alexander turned heads while putting his full array of skills on display, showing a proclivity for getting into the paint and not only scoring effectively at the rim and in the mid-range, but also setting up his teammates for easy looks. He is a natural distributor with a handle rarely seen of young guards. As a defender, Gilgeous-Alexander’s 6’6” frame and nearly 7-foot wingspan allow him to disrupt passing lanes and force deflections and turnovers. His high basketball IQ and physical tools often lead him to the right spots on both sides of the ball and in position to make an impact on the game.Starting each of his four games, Gilgeous-Alexander is the first player in Las Vegas Summer League history to average at least 19 points, four assists and two steals across a minimum of three appearances, despite playing just 27.8 minutes per contest. In the team’s two wins against Sacramento and Washington, he averaged 19.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.0 steals and shot 50 percent from the field and 40 percent from downtown.“I feel like I’m getting better each game and that’s all I really wanted to get out of Summer League. [I wanted to] get more comfortable and just get more adjusted to the plays now,” said Gilgeous-Alexander after last Wednesday’s win over the Wizards. “Obviously the real league is going to be a little bit different, but the same thing goes for that, just get better every game.”A rangy 6’5” guard, Robinson showed off a skill-set reminiscent of other sharpshooting, instant-offense sparkplugs that have been successful in the NBA in recent years. He is a confident jump-shooter, unafraid to attack defenders eager to close him out behind the arc with either a step-back or strong drive to the basket. His strong court vision affords him the ability to create for his teammates and see the floor as plays develop.Despite missing three games for rest, Robinson started each of the three games in which he appeared, averaging 13.7 points, 2.7 rebounds and 1.7 assists in just under 24 minutes, and connected on at least two three-point attempts in each game.Robinson’s biggest takeaways arguably came off the court, in conversations with head coach Doc Rivers and team consultant Jerry West. “It is great to have those guys in your corner, being able to grab their experiences and their knowledge and applying it to my game as best as possible,” said Robinson. “It is a great experience. There are things for us to hone-in and work on. I am sure we will have more [discussions] than just the short time we had here.”Although Summer League was just the first pit stop for these promising young prospects, both Gilgeous-Alexander and Robinson seized the opportunity to demonstrate the character, work ethic and skill-set that convinced the Clippers’ front office to select them as lottery picks in last month’s draft. With training camp opening in just over two months, fans can look forward to following the duo as they begin their rookie seasons and launch their NBA careers.


Current Clippers Assistant Coach Kim Hughes will immediately assume the role of Interim Head Coach, and will retain the position through the remainder of the 09-10 season.Your browser does not support iframes.In defining the move, Dunleavy said, Ive had several conversations with our owner (Donald T. Sterling) concerning what we think is best for the team overall. We have discussed the possibility of my concentrating only on Basketball Operations. That option has always been available to me.Dunleavy continued, Ive come to the conclusion that this is the ideal time for me to direct my efforts toward the many personnel opportunities that lie before us, such as the trade market, the Draft and the free agent process. We fully expect to be active and productive on all those fronts.Roeser stated, We fully agree with Mike that this is the right time to make this change. It just seems clear that the team needs a fresh voice and we hope that our players will respond in a positive way. As we approach the trade deadline, the NBA Draft and the upcoming Free Agent period, our team is very well-positioned from a salary cap standpoint.  Mikes experienced input will be vitally important as we continue to develop our young talented nucleus and shape our teams future.The Clippers all-time franchise leader in wins with 215, Dunleavy has coached the 15th most games in NBA history (1,329) and became the 21st coach in NBA history to win 600 career games on Nov. 29, 2009.

7/11/12The Los Angeles Clippers today traded forward Reggie Evans to the Brooklyn Nets in a sign-and-trade deal in exchange for the right to swap second round picks with the Nets in the 2016 NBA Draft.In 56 games played last season, Evans averaged 1.9 points, 4.8 rebounds and 13.8 minutes per game.

NEW ORLEANS – Glen “Big Baby” Davis had only been with the Clippers for a few minutes Monday morning, but even then it was clear how much he could help them in their drive toward the Playoffs.Davis, who mutually agreed to a contract buyout with the Orlando Magic on Friday, signed with the Clippers after clearing waivers. He joined the team in New Orleans for the final game of their three-game road trip and took part in the morning meeting to prepare for the Pelicans, eating breakfast with his new teammates. He will wear jersey No. 12 on Monday and likely switch to No. 0, his number at LSU, when the team returns home.“It really hasn’t hit me yet,” Davis said. “It really hasn’t dawned on me. Everything’s happened so fast. Today was my first day of just really eating breakfast with the guys. It’s my first experience of bringing back old memories, especially with Doc [Rivers] and Armond Hill and [Tyronn Lue] and Kevin Eastman. They’re a great group of guys and I won a championship with them, so we have a bond.” Davis, 28, played the first four seasons of his career in Boston with Rivers and a number of the Clippers assistants that he named. He won a title in 2008 as a rookie and was an integral part of the team’s run to the Finals in 2010.He’s appeared in 69 postseason games, including five with the Magic two seasons ago. He started 14 games for the Celtics in the 2009 Playoffs place of Kevin Garnett (knee), averaging 15.8 points, 5.6 rebounds and shooting 49.1 percent from the floor. He hit the biggest shot of the postseason as well, nailing a jumper off a pick-and-roll feed from Paul Pierce at the buzzer to give Boston a 95-94 victory over Orlando in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals.Getting back to the postseason after missing out in 2012-13 and having a chance to win a second title is something that weighed heavily in Davis’ decision to join the Clippers (38-20) instead of other potential suitors.“I’ve always made the Playoffs in my career and not playing for something was crazy,” Davis said. “Being on this team is some fresh energy, knowing that you can help a team win a championship is important. It feels good.”And he should make an impact right away. He knows Rivers’ system. He is a willing and rugged post defender, and while Davis is not ideal in terms of height, he has the rebounding ability and toughness to play center or power forward.“It gives us another big,” Rivers said. “What I like about a guy like that is he can play the 5 or the 4. He knows my system.”He could be valuable as a pick-and-pop player with Chris Paul, playing alongside Blake Griffin or DeAndre Jordan. He also can provide offensive balance. In 2010-11, Davis scored 22.4 percent of his points in spot up situations and 22.1 percent on post ups, according to Synergy Sports.“It’s awesome, especially for me being a guy who sets screens and gets guys open,” Davis said of Paul. “He finds them. That is just awesome. It makes it so much easier for me, having a guy who can find me. It kind of gives me an advantage.”In Davis’ final season with the Celtics he shot 36.1 percent from 16-24 feet, taking 321 field goals from that distance. Davis was most deadly that season from 10-14 feet, shooting 45.2 percent."With us [in Boston], we had Perk [Kendrick Perkins] and we had Kevin Garnett [inside]," Rivers said when the Clippers visited Orlando in November. "We needed a guy to stretch the floor. And so we really worked with him [Davis] and asked him to do that. He did that for the good of the team and it was important for us."Of course, Davis also provides an emotional lift.“He always plays hard,” Jamal Crawford said. “He wears his emotions on his sleeve. Obviously, being with Doc before helps. There is not an adjustment there. He knows what to expect every single night.“There are things he’ll be able to tell, being with Doc before. He’ll be like, ‘No, no, you can go that way or that way.’ I think that could help tremendously.”Davis agreed.“What Doc wants is for you to play hard and play the right way, give yourself up for the next guy,” Davis said. “That was embedded in my brain as a rookie and my four years playing with him. That’s just a part of my game. The think he noticed it and asked me to come along.”



On Sunday, January 13th Clippers' center Chris Kaman revealed on ESPN's "Outside the Lines" that as a child he was misdiagnosed with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Kaman learned from Dr. Tim Royer that he does not have ADHD, but rather what Royer calls "an anxious brain." Kaman's brain was working too fast, not too slow as implied by his previous ADHD diagnosis.The Clippers center has been working with Royer and Neurofeedback technology since last July. The technology requires Kaman to sit in front a computer screen that monitors his brain waves. This exercise helps him learn how to regulate his brain waves so that he can focus, which he attributes to the career season he's having.My uncle, who I really admire and I trust his opinion, gave me Dr. Royers number. We met, and I didnt really get it at first, but once I figured out how it worked, I liked it and wanted to try it.Now thinking back, Im in a position now where Im able to help people who were like me when I was younger. I wouldnt change the past because of where Im at now  Im really blessed.Were working with schools all over the country to get kids into the program. We can help them with test scores, IQ scores and grade point averages. Its benefited a lot of kids, so I thought I needed to get involved.

The USA Basketball Mens National Team program has come a long way as the elite list of players who are now part of our program shows. The selected finalists are a very, very talented group; the depth of the talent is extraordinary. This selection decision was as difficult of a challenge as Ive faced since I took on the USA National Team program in 2005, said Colangelo, who has served as the managing director of the USA Mens National Team since 2005. I feel like we have an outstanding blend of talents from the 2008 Olympic and 2010 World Championship teams that won gold. Reducing to the official roster limit of 12 players will be an even tougher decision, but well evaluate how guys play during the 2011-12 NBA season and as weve done with our teams in the past, well attempt to select the very best team we can.Jerry has built an extremely deep and talented USA National Team roster of 35 players and I want to thank each player for their incredible commitment to being part of USA Basketball. Reducing to 20 players was unbelievably difficult, stated Krzyzewski, who has coached USA National Teams to a sterling 48-1 record since 2006.Aside from the obvious special basketball talents that all of these players possess, what struck me most about the finalists was their commitment to USA Basketball and the international basketball experience they have compiled. Among our 20 finalists, we have two players who possess 55 or more games of international experience, two with 40 or more international games under their belts and eight others who have played between 23 and 38 international games  thats a lot of experience, which is going to be extremely valuable. These players have helped restore the winning tradition of USA Basketball while also gaining the respect of people around the world for the manner in which they have done it, added Krzyzewski.Three of the finalists are two-time Olympic medalists, including Anthony (2004 bronze and 2008 gold), James (2004 bronze and 2008 gold) and Wade (2004 bronze and 2008 gold).  Eight of the selected finalists were members of the 2008 U.S. Olympic team that compiled an unblemished record of 8-0 and captured gold in Beijing, including Anthony, Bosh, Bryant, Howard, James, Paul, Wade and Williams.

The Los Angeles Clippers today acquired guard Sebastian Telfair, forward Craig Smith and forward Mark Madsen from the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for forward Quentin Richardson.Richardson, who was re-acquired by the Clippers in a trade with Memphis on July 17, joins his fifth NBA team in the Timberwolves. We are really excited to add these three players to our team, Clippers General Manager and Head Coach Mike Dunleavy said. This move really gives some much needed depth.Telfair, 23, averaged a career-high 9.8 points, 4.6 assists, 1.7 rebounds and 27.9 minutes in 75 games last year for the Timberwolves. A five-year NBA veteran who was drafted by Portland with the 13th overall selection in the 2004 NBA Draft, Telfair joins his fourth NBA team. A 6-foot point guard, Telfair brings career averages of 8.2 points, 4.0 assists and 1.7 rebounds in 349 total NBA games to Los Angeles.

Currently fourth on the Blazers in scoring in 2009-10 averaging 9.9 points per game, the six-foot-nine forward has appeared in 377 career NBA games, starting 26 with career averages of 9.9 points, 3.5 rebounds and 0.7 assists.Your browser does not support iframes.Camby leaves the Clippers in the midst of his second season with the club after coming to Los Angeles in a trade with Denver on July 15, 2008. A 13-year NBA veteran and former NBA Defensive Player of the Year, Camby has appeared and started in 51 games for L.A. this season, averaging 7.7 points and 12.1 rebounds  the second highest total in the league.In a related roster move, the Clippers also waived combo guard Ricky Davis.Davis, 30, in his 12th NBA season is averaging 4.4 points, 1.6 rebounds and 1.1 assists in 36 games in 2009-10.

That competitiveness stays with Paul everywhere he goes, and it’s a trait Paul said he’s always had as a younger brother, playing with his older brother in the backyard. Whether Paul’s guiding the Clippers on the court, participating in an All-Star Game or taking part in Dwyane Wade’s spades tournament, as he did during All-Star Weekend, he’s not taking it lightly.Paul, by the way, won the tournament with his mother. “I didn’t play with my wife, because my wife’s not competitive,” Paul said with a grin. “She doesn’t care who wins.”Paul loves his family more than anything, but he doesn’t hide his competitiveness. It’s part of what makes him the leader he is, and the best guards around the league recognize that fire.  “He has no weaknesses,” said Wade, one of Paul’s best friends at All-Star Weekend. “His only weakness is he’s short, and that ain’t a weakness, because he’s feisty. He’s everywhere on the floor.”Wade clarified that Paul’s not short, just “shorter.” Regardless, Wade said it doesn’t matter.“Chris is one of the biggest competitors this game has ever seen,” Wade said. “He’s a great leader, obviously everyone knows that, but the guy has no weaknesses on the basketball floor. He can do everything.”Wade then referenced what the Clippers have done with Blake Griffin down. The Clippers went 18-5 before the All-Star break when their star forward went down, and Paul took his game to another level, averaging 21.1 points, 10.4 assists and 2.3 steals per game in January and 23.8 points, 8.2 assists and 2.8 rebounds per game thus far in February.Even in the Clippers’ overtime loss in Boston, their final game before the break, Paul posted 35 points, 13 assists, five rebounds and three steals.“You look at his team without Blake, see the things they’re able to accomplish,” Wade said. “Obviously his teammates have stepped up in his absence, but Chris has a lot to do with that.”Wade knows what it’s like to be one of the few veteran guards to go to the All-Star Game year after year in a league with an increasing number of young, athletic, scoring point guards changing the way people view the backcourt positions.That’s part of what makes the work of Paul, who was named an All-Star for the ninth straight time, impressive to his fellow All-Stars.  “The way that the league is going now with all the athletic point guards and the non-traditional point guards, and for him to still kind of be at the top of the game, being that traditional point guard, it says a lot about him,” Anthony said.John Wall said much of the same.“Some people can make it once, twice, then fall off,” Wall said. “But he can make it consecutive years. It means you’re doing something big in this league.”It’s a funny feeling for Paul being the veteran point guard at All-Star weekend now.Apart from Bryant, Paul’s the only guard on the Western Conference side with at least six All-Star selections. He has four more All-Star appearances than Russell Westbrook, who’s the next closest guard with five.“You get to know what to expect,” Paul said. “Isaiah Thomas, who plays for Boston, I’m actually pretty close with Isaiah. I saw him coming into the team meeting. It was cool to see him coming in there for the first time, because I remember that.”Looking around and seeing veteran leaders such as Paul in the same All-Star Game as him, Thomas – who attended Paul’s camps growing up – will likely remember it even more.“He’s somebody that I think is one of the best point guards in the world and somebody I look up to,” Thomas said. “He’s probably the most competitive guy you’ll ever meet.All Star Hub 2016Share Links:

He can also do the same thing when the opponent is an eye exam. “Line 8 on the chart says, ‘F-E-L-O-P-Z-D,’” Paul recited from memory Wednesday morning. “And Line 9 says, ‘D-E-F-P-O-T-E-C.”Why stress to read the lines if the meticulous preparer could just remember them? But for 10 years, ever since Paul’s father and brother had LASIK eye surgery during Paul’s rookie year in Oklahoma, Paul’s family stayed on him to do the same.And for 10 years, it never happened. “As long as I could see the rim, I felt like I was cool,” Paul said. Until this summer.After more prodding, already needing to rest after surgery to his fractured hand, Paul finally caved.“My brother sent me a text the other day saying my percentages are up because of my LASIK eye surgery,” Paul said. Whether he’s hitting shots at a higher rate because of the procedure or not, it’s hard to argue with the results.Paul, who’s shot better than 40 percent from 3-point range for a season only once in his career and has never shot better than 41 percent from 3-point range for a full season, is currently hitting 47.3 percent of his 3-pointers in 2016-17 and 50 percent of his shots from 16 feet out to the 3-point line. Seeing the rim can’t hurt. “I like to think that I have something to do with it,” Paul said with a grin. “But, it might be. I do see a lot better than I did. Probably not squinting as much.”Head coach Doc Rivers joked that he just thought Paul’s squinting during games was from the guard being upset about something he said. In reality, though, Rivers said every year the Clippers encourage their players to make sure their eyes are right. “We don’t actually know when it started going bad for him, but it is important,” Rivers said. “It is amazing, sometimes from year to year, how different their vision is. When you have point guards, it’s pretty important you have clear vision.”And whether Paul wanted to admit it or not, there was room for improvement. The squinting was the sign C.J. always noticed. “He squinted bad,” C.J. said. “I was like, ‘Man, if you get LASIK, you don’t have to squint. He was a nervous wreck.”Paul, admittedly somewhat of a hypochondriac, isn’t afraid to admit that, saying LASIK was one of the most nerve-racking things he’d ever decided to do.But he had his older brother’s success story to know how easy it could be. “That’s one of the best things I ever did,” C.J. said. “The next morning I went to a doctor to get a checkup, then that night I sat in a suite at the game.”C.J. went through with the procedure in Oklahoma after years of wearing glasses. He could never put contacts in his eyes, and he never wore anything when he played basketball, so he thought it would be a prudent solution. “I actually went and watched somebody have it done - just a random person,” C.J. said. The whole process took roughly eight minutes. “I was like, ‘I could do this,’” C.J. said. And if C.J.’s success story wasn’t enough, it couldn’t hurt that Paul had ophthalmologist Kerry Assil, the same doctor who successfully performed LASIK on Richard Hamilton, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, among other athletes, to go to. “My doctor who did the surgery, who was amazing by the way, his other clients, he said their percentages went up that next season,” Paul said. Soon after Paul went through the procedure, Paul George did the same, right before the Olympics. As of Wednesday afternoon, George is hitting a career-high 41.4 percent of his 3-point shots this year. Meanwhile, Chris Paul enters a matchup against the Grizzlies having hit 17 of his last 27 3-point attempts. The eye drops Paul had to take a few times a day for a few weeks after the procedure seems well worth the pay-off.  

After five NBA seasons, Johnson finally found himself on a team bound for the postseason for the first time, an experience Rivers got to go through for the first time last year. “I was extremely nervous – not scared nervous, just nervous because you’ve never played at that level of intensity before,” Rivers recalled. When Johnson first checked into the game at the 4:09 mark in the first quarter, in between two Blake Griffin free throws, Rivers could tell Johnson felt the same way. Or, at least he thought. It’s tough to tell how the mild-mannered and easygoing forward is feeling. His facial expression rarely changes, save for a few grins on the court. “I don’t know if Wes is happy or sad,” Rivers said. “Wes would be a great card player, poker player. You can tell when he’s happy about something, he’ll smile. But when he’s mad, you don’t know. I’ll ask, ‘Is something wrong,’ and even then he’ll be like, ‘Nah, I’m good.’ You just don’t know.”On Sunday, whether his countenance showed it or not, it was all anxious giddiness inside. Johnson talked to teammates and got advice before the end of the regular season about how the environment changes. After all, he’s the only player on the Clippers other than rookie Branden Dawson without any postseason experience. “Everybody’s telling me it’s a different atmosphere, a different feel,” Johnson said. “The intensity rises.”That excited Johnson, who couldn’t help but get a grin on his face while sitting at his locker in Phoenix on the last day of the regular season, knowing what was ahead. Johnson put up numbers in two years in Minnesota, another year in Phoenix and two years with the Lakers, but never saw what it was like to play past 82 regular season games. He had waited longer than Rivers had for his first taste of the playoffs, and even the road to get there this year had its tolls. He played with plantar fasciitis in both feet toward the end of the season, forcing him to switch out orthotics and try different methods to get out on the court. He said the beginning of games is typically the toughest as he tries to warm up, and he hopes that the breaks between games in the postseason will lessen the load on his feet.Johnson wasn’t going to miss his first chance to play in the playoffs, so after getting a couple games off to rest late in the year, he returned for the final three games of the regular season for a final tune-up as part of a bench unit that’s lessened the load on the Clippers’ starters this season. “There’s been a lot of guys that have stepped up and taken on bigger roles,” Griffin said. “I’m really proud of Wes, the way he’s stuck with it all year dealing with plantar fasciitis and dealing with different stuff here and there.”It was all a buildup for Sunday night. When Johnson finally recorded his first career playoff minutes in Game 1, he did his best to keep composed, though he committed a foul about 13 seconds into the game. After that, he settled down.“That’s how I felt last year, I was extremely nervous,” Rivers said. “But once you start playing, you’re good.”Johnson played nine minutes, dishing out a quick assist before finishing with two rebounds, a block and a 3-pointer in the corner by the end of the night. “It was definitely what I thought it was going to be,” Johnson said. “When I was out there, I was really just trying to stick to the same rotations. But after I hit the first shot, everything went away, and I was all right.”Unfortunately for Johnson, that 3-point shot didn’t come until less than a minute remained in the game. Ideally for Johnson, the momentum from that shot, which calmed the nerves, carries over to Wednesday’s Game 2. 

Gordon, originally selected by the Clippers as the seventh overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft, begins his third NBA season and is now signed through the 2011-12 campaign. Under the NBAs Collective Bargaining Agreement, the Clippers had the right to exercise these contract options.  The 63 guard out of Indiana has averaged 16.4 points, 2.9 assists and 2.6 rebounds over his two-year NBA career and is coming off helping Team USA win the gold medal in the 2010 FIBA World Championships in Istanbul, Turkey earlier this month.  In nine games played in the tournament, Gordon tallied 8.6 points while finishing second on the team in three-pointers made (19) and second on the team in three-point field goal percentage (.452). Griffin, the first overall selection by the Clippers in the 2009 NBA Draft is now also signed through the 2011-12 season, with the Clippers holding the right of first refusal.  Griffin missed the entire 2009-10 campaign due to a fractured left patella making 2010-11 his official rookie season.Back to Top

OKLAHOMA CITY – Blake Griffin’s finest season as a professional was validated in many ways Tuesday afternoon.Griffin, who averaged a career-high 24.1 points per game in 80 games, had a team-high 43 double-doubles and was named an All-Star starter for the third consecutive season, was announced as the third place finisher in the NBA’s Most Valuable Player balloting.Griffin received 434 points, including one second-place vote, to finish behind Kevin Durant (1,232 points) and LeBron James (891). Durant received his award Tuesday afternoon at a press conference in Oklahoma City.“I’m honored really. It’s hard to believe,” Griffin said after a team meeting as the Clippers prepare for Game 2 of their postseason series with Durant’s Thunder. “I said earlier that it was kind of a two-man race and towards the end there it was kind of a no-brainer.“Third place, you don’t really get a trophy for that,” Griffin added. “It’s nice to be considered like that, but at the same time I think I have a lot of areas for improvement.”Griffin put together a rare all-around season, becoming the first player since Tim Duncan in 2001-02 to average at least 24 points, nine rebounds, 3.5 assists and shoot 50 percent or better from the field. He also helped lead the Clippers to a franchise record 57 wins, including a 12-6 record when fellow superstar Chris Paul was out with a separated shoulder.Paul finished seventh in the MVP race. In addition, reserve guard Jamal Crawford is considered the leading candidate for Sixth Man of the Year and center DeAndre Jordan finished third in Defensive Player of the Year voting and fifth in Most Improved balloting.“It shows that we have a lot of depth,” Paul said. “Obviously, me, Blake and D.J. are the leaders of our team. All that’s good and well, but everything is to win a championship. All the individual accolades come with the success of the team.” As for Griffin, Clippers head coach Doc Rivers did not sound surprised that Griffin finished as high as he did for MVP. In fact, he had suggested Griffin would be at least third a couple of months ago.“It does validate it,” Griffin said. “I thought he would be third. I thought he had a chance at second actually for a while. He had a sensational season and he’s being noticed for it.”

BECOMES FIRST PLAYER IN FRANCHISE HISTORY TO RECEIVE THE HONORLos Angeles Clippers’ guard Jamal Crawford is the winner of the 2013-14 Kia NBA Sixth Man Award as the league’s best player in a reserve role, the National Basketball Association announced today. Crawford, who also won the award in 2009-10 while with the Atlanta Hawks, joins Kevin McHale, Ricky Pierce and Detlef Schrempf as two-time winners.  He is also the first player in NBA history to win the award for two separate teams and at 34 is the oldest player ever to receive the honor.The 2013-14 season is Crawford’s second in Los Angeles, one in which he finished as the NBA’s fourth leading scorer in the fourth quarter (6.8 points). He was one of only two players in the top 12 who played more games as a reserve than as a starter.Crawford amassed 57 first-place votes and 421 total points from a panel of 125 sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada.In order to be eligible for this award, players were required to have come off the bench in more games than they started. Players were awarded five points for each first-place vote, three points for each second-place vote and one point for each third-place vote.Crawford tallied double-figure scoring efforts in 15-of-16 January games, as the Clippers posted a 12-4 record. On Jan. 25, Crawford poured in 37 points and handed out 11 assists in a 126-118 win over the Toronto Raptors. The 37 points were the most scored off the bench in his career and the most he has tallied in a Clipper uniform. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, no player other than Crawford has ever had at least 31 points and 11 assists in a game that he did not start. Crawford did so twice (Jan. 25 and Nov. 29 when he had 31 points and 11 assists against the Kings). For the season, he posted 20-plus points 29 times and 30-plus points six times. The Clippers were 31-14 (.689) in games in which Crawford appeared off the bench.As part of its support of the Sixth Man Award, Kia Motors America (KMA) will donate an all-new 2015 Kia Sorento LX CUV to a charity of Crawford’s choice.   Kia Motors will present a Sorento to the charity of choice of each of five 2013-14 year-end award winners as part of “The Kia NBA Performance Awards.”  Following this season, Kia Motors will have donated a total of 31 new vehicles to charitable organizations since its support of the NBA’s prestigious year-end honors began in 2008.Following are the balloting results for the 2013-14 Kia NBA Sixth Man Award.

Rookie guard Shaun Livingston suffered a dislocation of his right patella (kneecap) during todays practice at the Spectrum Club South Bay.  Livingston was examined by team physician Dr. Tony Daly, and is expected to be out of action for at least eight weeks.  A subsequent MRI revealed no other structural damage to the joint.  Livingston will begin a rehabilitation program conducted by the Clippers team medical staff and will be re-evaluated regularly.The fourth overall selection in the 2004 NBA Draft, Livingston has tallied 5.0 points, 2.6 assists, 2.1 rebounds and 21.2 minutes during the first eleven games of the season.
Fans can listen to color commentary from the Michael Smith alongside the "Voice of the Clippers" Ralph Lawler on Prime Ticket and KFWB 980 AM.Former Clipper Michael Smith begins his twelfth season behind the microphone for the Clippers and his eighth partnering with Ralph Lawler on all Clippers broadcasts. Prior to his permanent move to the Clippers television broadcast team, Smith served as the Clippers radio play-by-play voice for four seasons. When his playing days ended in 1996, Smith began his broadcasting career as a color analyst working for NBC in Salt Lake City calling all of his alma maters televised basketball games at BYU.Smith began his broadcast career just as his playing career came to a close. Chronically sore knees and a young familys duties led him to begin a new life after three seasons in the NBA and another four overseas in Europe. Originally drafted by the Boston Celtics in 1989 as the 13th overall selection, Smith started eight games his rookie year in the middle of the season, a span during which he averaged 18 points per game and the Celtics went 7-1. He played in Europe from 1991-1995, and led the Spanish League in scoring and free throw percentage for two different seasons. He was also the leading American scorer in the Italian League. In 1995, Smith returned to the Clippers for one season. While this stint was brief, it allowed him the opportunity to return to the city where he had excelled in his early days.Smith attended Los Altos High School in Hacienda Heights, where he set CIF football records for yardage, attempts, completions, and the single-game record for TDs (8) as a quarterback on the way to the CIF championship. That year he was chosen the National Male High School Athlete of the Year by the Dial Corporation, after being First Team All-American in football, basketball and volleyball. Smith was recruited by virtually every university in the country to play any or all of the three sports. He chose BYU and basketball. Accolades at the college level continued: he was an All-American his junior year and led the team to a 26-6 record, led the conference in scoring three times, was a two-time WAC Player of the Year, led the nation in free throw percentage his senior year, and was a three-time First Team Academic All American, majoring in Spanish with a minor in Communications.Smith and his family reside in South Orange County.

Now that it has, he’s not going to rush to a decision on whether or not this was his last run. “Right now, it’s 50-50,” Pierce said. “I don’t want to make an emotional decision.”Pierce has two years and roughly $7 million left on his deal, but he knew when he came back home to Los Angeles any year could be his last. The former NBA champion and 10-time All-Star forward is 38 years old and will be 39 before the start of next season. This last season with the Clippers was the first time he averaged single digits in scoring in his career and the first time he played fewer than 20 minutes per game. “We’ll see how I feel when I wake up,” Pierce said, figuratively speaking following the Game 6 loss. “If I don’t feel that feel, that fire’s not there, then it’s going to be tough (to keep playing).”Whatever Pierce decides, head coach Doc Rivers doesn’t want to play much of a role in the choice.  Pierce has now spent a decade of his life playing for Rivers, with nine years together in Boston and now another in Los Angeles, but Rivers said that decision is too personal to get involved in.“That’s a decision that Paul’s going to have to make,” Rivers said. “He’ll ask, and I’ll give him what I think and very little of that, because I think players, as far as thinking about retirement, have to come to that conclusion – even though I’m more than a coach to him.”Rivers said he wouldn’t ever want Pierce to be sitting at home regretting whatever choice he made.  “I think that’s a hard one,” Rivers said.  So, Pierce will take his time and try to figure it out. Pierce has said he’s debated after each of the past few seasons whether he’d continue to keep playing, and it’s a choice that never gets easier.“Every heartbreak makes you want to come back,” Pierce said. “That’s the competitive nature of a player. That’s the competitive nature of me.” And, that’s why the Inglewood native has plenty to consider. 
The LA Clippers signed rookie center Angel Delgado to a two-way contract, it was announced today by President of Basketball Operations, Lawrence Frank.Delgado, 23, played four collegiate seasons at Seton Hall University, where he appeared in 132 games, averaging 12.1 points and 11.0 rebounds in 30.6 minutes. The 6’10”, 245-pound center led the country in rebounding and won the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award for the nation’s best center, as a senior.He represented his native Dominican Republic in the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup, where he appeared in three games, averaging 8.7 points and 8.3 rebounds in 23.5 minutes.Per NBA rules, teams are permitted to have two players signed to two-way contracts on the roster at any given time, along with their 15-man regular season roster. A two-way player for the Clippers will provide services to the team’s G League affiliate – the Agua Caliente Clippers of Ontario – and can spend up to 45 days with L.A., in addition to the time prior to the start of G-League training camp and after the G-League season concludes.
The LA Clippers have signed guards Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jerome Robinson, it was announced today by Clippers President of Basketball Operations, Lawrence Frank. Per team policy, terms of the agreement were not released.  Selected 11th overall in the first round of the 2018 NBA Draft, Gilgeous-Alexander played one collegiate season at Kentucky, where he appeared in 37 games (24 starts), averaging 14.4 points, 5.1 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 1.6 steals in 33.7 minutes. The 6’6”, 180-pound guard shot 48.5 percent from the field and 40.4 percent from three-point range as a Wildcat. A native of Hamilton, Ontario (Canada), the 19-year old was named to the Second-team All-SEC and the SEC All-Freshman Team, and was named the MVP of the SEC Tournament.  Selected 13th overall in the first round of the 2018 NBA Draft, Robinson played three collegiate seasons at Boston College, where he appeared in 90 career games (all starts), averaging 17.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 1.3 steals in 34.6 minutes. The 6’5”, 188-pound guard shot 45.0 percent from the field and 37.6 percent from three-point range in his Boston College career. A native of Raleigh, North Carolina, the 21-year old was named All-ACC First Team as a Junior.  follow and keep up with Shai and Jerome

Ralphs long tenure with the club has seen him surpass 2,400 regular season and play-off Clipper broadcasts as his enthusiastic calls of Bingo!, Fasten your Seatbelts and "Oh Me Oh My" continue to be familiar favorites for Clippers fans throughout Southern California.Lawlers busy schedule has him handling play-by-play duties for all televised games on PRIME TICKET and on the Clippers new flagship radio station, KFWB 980 AM, for all non-televised contests.Lawlers list of honors include Emmy and Golden Mike Awards as well as past recognition as Pennsylvania Sportscaster of the Year during his stint in Philadelphia at WCAU AM & TV. He has been named to the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame.The NBA has long been Lawlers great love. However, the versatile broadcaster is one of only a handful of announcers who have worked play-by-play in each of the four major pro sports leagues: NFL (San Diego Chargers), MLB (Philadelphia Phillies), NHL (Philadelphia Flyers) and NBA (76ers and Clippers). His resume also includes broadcasting events as varied as ABA and college basketball, golf, tennis, track & field, auto racing, boxing and college football. Ralph is a graduate of Bradley University in Peoria, Ill., and was inducted into his alma maters Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. Hes another in a long line of sportscasters who honed their craft in Peoria.He spends his offseason keeping tabs on all matters involving the NBA and is a regular spectator at the Las Vegas Summer Pro League games. Notable offseason activities have included a week aboard the SS Norway as the radio host of an NBA Cruise of the Caribbean, an 18-day whitewater rafting trip down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon with former broadcast partner Bill Walton and service as the play-by-play voice for one of Nintendos NBA Courtside video games.Ralph and his wife, Jo, proudly head a family that includes three grown children and seven grandchildren.

After accomplishing as much as the organization did last year, a great deal of optimism loomed for the Clippers as the summer progressed. After acquiring Chris Paul last December, they did the best job possible of composing a roster ready for battle alongside Blake Griffin and Paul.  The mentality reminded me of how I pick my fantasy football team: Do I pick the best players available or do I get the positions I need?  In a year where the offseason was fewer than two weeks, you don’t have a choice.  You grab what you can like you’re in one of those vacuums that has an assortment of bills flying around, some of the $1 variety, others a larger denomination.  The Clippers grabbed what they could, and had more than a few Benjamins in their pockets. They perhaps had the best “offseason” in the NBA in 2011 and while the volume of talent was better than anything a Clipper fan had seen, it has been trumped.Last year’s roster of 15 essentially had eight spots committed to two positions: point guard and power forward. In fact, at one point, Eric Bledsoe was the fifth guard on the roster (mostly due to a knee injury he suffered in the offseason). This summer, the front office, comprised of Vinny Del Negro, Andy Roeser, and Gary Sacks, did an outstanding job of finding great balance and versatility without breaking the bank. With a combination of veterans who have “been there and done that” with superstars in their prime, who are desperate to win, this season and the foreseeable future, for that matter, is going to be special.The depth, athleticism, and versatility will be the best in the NBA.  That doesn’t mean it’s going to be a 60-win season.  There are always problems, but with this set of tools, Del Negro has everything at his disposal.  The Clippers are legit title contenders.THE BOTTOM 4 PLAYOFF CONTENDERSTEAM TO WATCHUNCERTAIN FUTUREQUESTION MARKS
When Isaiah Thomas caught fire in a seven-game playoff series against Washington last year, he did so with a Lakers legend in his ear.Thomas was playing for the Boston Celtics at the time, making it all the stranger that Kobe Bryant was giving him constant advice throughout the postseason.“We’d be on FaceTime watching film together on speakerphone,” Thomas said during his Lakers Voices chat on Tuesday. “He would tell me what he sees, what I can do and what I can do better to be able to get my team a win. That was throughout the whole playoffs.“That was special to me, because to be able to have Kobe Bryant talk to you and help you out is amazing, especially for me. That was my favorite player growing up.”Thomas — now playing for the purple and gold — was a big Lakers fan as a kid thanks to his father, James, who is from Inglewood.So that’s why, a few years ago, Thomas contacted through his people to see if Bryant would be willing to let him pick his brain before a game between the Celtics and Lakers.Bryant agreed and spent an hour talking with Thomas. Afterward, they kept in touch over text, and Bryant reached out to Thomas when his sister, Chyna, died in a tragic car accident during the opening round of the playoffs.Through his emotional pain, Thomas continued to play at his MVP-caliber level. When it came to a second-round series with the Wizards, he hit a new level, thanks in part to Bryant’s advice.“I’m a guy that watches a lot of film … and I thought what I was watching were the right things,” Thomas said. “When we first sat down and watched film last playoffs, he was just going in so much detail of things that I never even looked at on film.”Bryant advised that Thomas watch film on Stephen Curry, including studying how the Golden State point guard would set screens to open up scoring opportunities for himself and others.Thomas soared in that series, averaging 27.4 points, 7.1 assists and 3.6 3-pointers.“It was crazy, because I never even thought about basketball like that,” Thomas said. “And then when I started to think like that, I would see it before it happened in the game and I would think, ‘Damn, Kobe really just told me that last night.’”NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.
Here is what you need to know before the Lakers don their MPLS uniforms against the Orlando Magic.It has been a large enough sample size to confirm that Julius Randle has taken the next step as a scorer.On the season, he is averaging 15.2 points on a 56.1 field goal percentage that ranks ninth in the entire NBA. But his last 14 games have been even more impressive.During this stretch, he has boosted his scoring average to 20.4 while actually increasing his efficiency with a 59.2 percent clip.Randle has made at least half of his shots in 11 straight games, as opponents haven’t found a way to consistently defend his mix of power and speed.After a 5-0 start to the post-All-Star Break slate, the Lakers’ offense finally sputtered against a Portland squad that is arguably playing the best defense in the league.The Lakers had averaged more than 121 points post-break until managing just 103 versus the Blazers, on a 39.5 field goal percentage that was their lowest since late December.In spite of this, the Lakers’ offense is still off to a strong start in the last stretch of the season.Before the break, they ranked 26th in offensive rating (102.8). After it, they are fifth (113.1).Much of this has to do with the play of Lonzo Ball, who finally had a quiet game against Portland. Plus, Isaiah Thomas — who also slipped versus the Blazers — has done a nice job of running the second unit.Theoretically, this Magic squad is an ideal team to bounce back against. They are just 1 1/2 games out of last place in the entire NBA, and they are 27th in terms of defensive efficiency.But the Lakers have fallen in this exact trap before.Five weeks ago they strolled into Orlando and were dealt a 22-point loss. The Lakers’ defense collapsed in that game, allowing the Magic to shoot 54.3 percent from the field.L.A. will need to take its opponent more seriously this time around.Fortunately for the Lakers, that loss seems to have helped turn the season’s tide. Since falling to the Magic, they have gone 9-4. Brandon Ingram (left groin strain), Josh Hart (left hand fourth metacarpal fracture) and Channing Frye (appendectomy) are out.Magic: Rashad Vaughn (sore right knee) is questionable. Terrence Ross (sprained right MCL, non-displaced fracture of right tibial plateau) is out. NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

When Isaiah Thomas caught fire in a seven-game playoff series against Washington last year, he did so with a Lakers legend in his ear.Thomas was playing for the Boston Celtics at the time, making it all the stranger that Kobe Bryant was giving him constant advice throughout the postseason.“We’d be on FaceTime watching film together on speakerphone,” Thomas said during his Lakers Voices chat on Tuesday. “He would tell me what he sees, what I can do and what I can do better to be able to get my team a win. That was throughout the whole playoffs.“That was special to me, because to be able to have Kobe Bryant talk to you and help you out is amazing, especially for me. That was my favorite player growing up.”Thomas — now playing for the purple and gold — was a big Lakers fan as a kid thanks to his father, James, who is from Inglewood.So that’s why, a few years ago, Thomas contacted through his people to see if Bryant would be willing to let him pick his brain before a game between the Celtics and Lakers.Bryant agreed and spent an hour talking with Thomas. Afterward, they kept in touch over text, and Bryant reached out to Thomas when his sister, Chyna, died in a tragic car accident during the opening round of the playoffs.Through his emotional pain, Thomas continued to play at his MVP-caliber level. When it came to a second-round series with the Wizards, he hit a new level, thanks in part to Bryant’s advice.“I’m a guy that watches a lot of film … and I thought what I was watching were the right things,” Thomas said. “When we first sat down and watched film last playoffs, he was just going in so much detail of things that I never even looked at on film.”Bryant advised that Thomas watch film on Stephen Curry, including studying how the Golden State point guard would set screens to open up scoring opportunities for himself and others.Thomas soared in that series, averaging 27.4 points, 7.1 assists and 3.6 3-pointers.“It was crazy, because I never even thought about basketball like that,” Thomas said. “And then when I started to think like that, I would see it before it happened in the game and I would think, ‘Damn, Kobe really just told me that last night.’”NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.
Here is what you need to know before the Lakers don their MPLS uniforms against the Orlando Magic.It has been a large enough sample size to confirm that Julius Randle has taken the next step as a scorer.On the season, he is averaging 15.2 points on a 56.1 field goal percentage that ranks ninth in the entire NBA. But his last 14 games have been even more impressive.During this stretch, he has boosted his scoring average to 20.4 while actually increasing his efficiency with a 59.2 percent clip.Randle has made at least half of his shots in 11 straight games, as opponents haven’t found a way to consistently defend his mix of power and speed.After a 5-0 start to the post-All-Star Break slate, the Lakers’ offense finally sputtered against a Portland squad that is arguably playing the best defense in the league.The Lakers had averaged more than 121 points post-break until managing just 103 versus the Blazers, on a 39.5 field goal percentage that was their lowest since late December.In spite of this, the Lakers’ offense is still off to a strong start in the last stretch of the season.Before the break, they ranked 26th in offensive rating (102.8). After it, they are fifth (113.1).Much of this has to do with the play of Lonzo Ball, who finally had a quiet game against Portland. Plus, Isaiah Thomas — who also slipped versus the Blazers — has done a nice job of running the second unit.Theoretically, this Magic squad is an ideal team to bounce back against. They are just 1 1/2 games out of last place in the entire NBA, and they are 27th in terms of defensive efficiency.But the Lakers have fallen in this exact trap before.Five weeks ago they strolled into Orlando and were dealt a 22-point loss. The Lakers’ defense collapsed in that game, allowing the Magic to shoot 54.3 percent from the field.L.A. will need to take its opponent more seriously this time around.Fortunately for the Lakers, that loss seems to have helped turn the season’s tide. Since falling to the Magic, they have gone 9-4. Brandon Ingram (left groin strain), Josh Hart (left hand fourth metacarpal fracture) and Channing Frye (appendectomy) are out.Magic: Rashad Vaughn (sore right knee) is questionable. Terrence Ross (sprained right MCL, non-displaced fracture of right tibial plateau) is out. NBA.com is part of Turner Sports Digital, part of the Turner Sports & Entertainment Digital Network.

It’s a crystal-clear December morning in South Florida. The sun is shining, very few clouds are in the sky and the temperature is in the mid-60s. A small taste of winter. And on this particular Saturday three days before Christmas, plenty of people are making their way to a local Walmart for last minute gifts. But perhaps nobody is happier than Randall Heidelburg. Why? Well, because when Udonis Haslem has something to say, you listen. With the help of his foundation, UD surprised Heidelburg and the students from the Expressive Arts magnet program at Charles R. Drew K-8 Center with a full-day excursion. After taking the students on a shopping spree and being generous with his time to others around the store, Haslem had a special gift for Heidelburg.

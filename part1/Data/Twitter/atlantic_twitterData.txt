Dudley to Simmons: 'What's up?' in the second quarter https://t.co/q7NXGHnVxI https://t.co/1YOwUa9L9A
The Nets are flying around the court. If the Sixers want to win, they gotta match Brooklyn's intensity.
#Sixers with 10 turnovers to the #Nets' 4 and Brooklyn with a 9-4 edge on offensive glass. Philly down six (63-57) at the half.
The @BrooklynNets are that hipster that says they’re from Brooklyn but they’re really from New Jersey. #HereTheyCome
@McLurfin @JustinHahn15 @eli413rapper @BrooklynNets @CarisLeVert Typical Philly fan negating every Brooklyn fan they see lmaoooooo
The Nets will lose this series, but if they can get a W here and make it interesting, that's enough for me #Brooklyn #Nets
Brooklyn Nets go crazy😂
Apparently Charles Barkley was just informed that the Nets are in Brooklyn not New Jersey lol #PHIvsBKN

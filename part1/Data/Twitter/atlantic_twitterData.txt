Nah we mean mugging everyone now. Fuck the refs, fuck Brooklyn, fuck all Nets fans. Don't come to Philly.
Jared Dudley and Jimmy Butler ejected with 7:42 left and Brooklyn up by 8. This is GREAT for the Nets.
The Nets basically sacrificed Dudley so they can get rid of Butler too. What a W for Brooklyn. üòÇ
Jimmy Butler and Jared Dudley ejected #Brooklyn #Nets #nbaplayoffs smh
So there was a fight in Brooklyn huh #WeGoHard #Nets #barclays
This Brooklyn and Philly game though üò® Losing Butler is going to really hurt the 76ers this game. Nets just got a HUGE help with that

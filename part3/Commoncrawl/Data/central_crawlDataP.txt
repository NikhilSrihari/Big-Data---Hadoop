mitigating factor like change coach trading holiday etc think losing mean status rebuild going take longer get back playoff many hoped think maybe group need time improve via maturing player playing together viable core perennial playoff team see sign yet championship contender thats im asking aboutcameron watkinswould could jabari parker go windy city bull nothing else playing time showcase play

 sam one tough make would golden state take chance deng leave free agent month barnes high level young small forward rookie contract three year go give center love believe final piece toward giving chance title yet another free agent could leave summer would little chance playing given allstar level guard course right player may come nba maybe wasnt one best wasnt worst bull acquire aldridge noah one year player trade deng asik throw guard houston new look bull would front line boozergibson asik center aldridge playing forward spot monster front line would tom allen

 sam actually think could get arrested course patently ridiculous arent team enough cap room absorb salary even wanted give expiring deal expiring deal big contract like boozer era extensive tax penalty there actual issue beyond bizarre unrealistic suggestion sport isnt winning drunken party sorry competing value game isnt management coaching staff trying win doesnt label failure loser team also owe best performance fan league game le cheat institution come back haunt player want associated organization accept failure quit game player never sensed even worst tim floyd time bull intended bull talk winning positive culture time also culture respect game sure could make trade might take step back time thats part process never ever quit season team especially assembled player high level competitor like bull coach staff committed best every game made pact fan paying customer everything possible put best product court make sure player give everything toward success every game deliver excellent show accept anything le violation trust community tolerated go play see great talent perform dont win show nba greatest athlete world playing unique game performing amazing sport action youll see anywhere always worth price effort matter score plus there always wonderful unknown story doesnt come play never truly know outcome unexpected happens make wonderful drama dont need run around foam finger enjoyed wonderful event loved last season bull basically chance win title many others fan franchise never title expect le complete effort bull even without rose strong roster high level motivated talented committed player like deng noah sell well would unfair looking forward season idea end im confident player make great effort put good show good im looking forward seeing trade noah expiring projected lottery pick love noah worth bull hell past contract end foot problem derailed many big man career aged would team like utah trouble signing free agent interested allstar center expiring biedrinsand likely lottery pick think dan frystak  
 sam chance miniscule getting even first round pick draft lottery pick maybe durant draft produce terrific player lebron durant player turn franchise around almost immediately problem medium fan saying team basically held hostage gm want keep job daring give one pick player like deng noah valuable star also system player werent nobody would suggesting trading without rose theyre valuable pick fan lottery team dont think check local medium city see story lottery prospect sell lottery pick fan sell ticket much harder time player named lebron think bull would make play jameer nelson andre miller point guard fill rose kind make sense could help keep bull relevant year may bad idea let rose play point guard going forward maybe much pressure john rallis  
 sam agree bull could use another point guard finding one problem think magic would like move nelson he owed million season million buyout next season giving making much gibson obviously young team playing young player little interest veteran presumably buy nelson season im big fan miller make almost million requiring losing good player plus he book next season well bull trying retain flexibility higher level player suspect denver team playoff aspiration would probably ask jimmy butler tony snell possibly butler mike dunleavy thats way much give deng small forward gallinari coming back soon surgery think chicago able get jabari parker draft frankie vane  
 sam obviously talk throwing season aimed player like chicago parker way college season gone far hed pick draft there long way draft workout go given strong family background desperate need money bright kid duke there talk parker could stay school didnt hurt tim duncan career skip overall pick two year row graduated nba life isnt glamorous travel relentless grind game college pretty good deal especially place like duke id advise son seriously consider staying school long could money always going yes know could get hurt doesnt everyone go work staying longer college always make better pro lot player came school early like kobe lebron hall famers better chance developed mature game truly reaching potential tough start think deng would fit great clipper dont know offer bull probably get late first round pick gibson alfredo rivas  
 sam deng excellent player he exactly clipper would want jared dudley small forward player like deng sense though nearly good he great athlete tough guy make shot dont isolate beat dribble plus paul griffin clipper big payroll anything cutting back gibson coming prime giving awayassuming someone could absorb salary give expiring dealfor pick getting pick even late first reserve player overreaction also continues fail take account rose prediction every doctor return high level excellent player sure could hurt perhaps there higher chance given he hurt player talent level dont allow play makeshift group draft pick virtually every one blowupthefranchise suggestion ive gotten based low odds luck draw seems build perpetual failure franchise anything im confident rose return terrific player id hate see bull panic surround rose prime year player dont give chance reach potential stephen fulton  
 sam knew someone would figure way bring back ben putting together lot mail think consensus bull team community gordon nate robinson malcolm thomas andres nocioni daequan cook ok four five theyre letting ben back circumstance plus considered taylor draft theyre building second rounder playing much charlotte yes get concept make charlotte better get pick lower bull worse get lottery build franchise two low lottery pick thus making bull first team since jazz build around pick teen yes jazz lucked stockton malone though make draft mistake like anymore billy habibi  
 sam thats minute life youre never getting back obviously drummond one ridiculous given theyve labeled hope future franchise wont ask many people hold health care yes see concept take best young prospect high lottery pick team unaware deng expiring deal wont resigning chance dont cable watch tv ive heard wizard one fan time make sense porter season wizard anxious something season got badly burned cashing pick player traded right ricky rubio randy foye mike miller im pretty sure theyre new owner said better trade deng nazr murphy knicks shumpert bargnani bull get young cheap ballhandling defensively sound two guard place next rose going forward upgrade backup centre knicks get allstar sf greatly improve title chance defense starting lineup keep stretch four option arguably taking minor hit backup centre jay hearfield  
 sam cant go wrong taking knicks player named carmelo wow bargnani book million year making way le raptor tried year trade point gm saying publicly everyone made fun knicks huge deal course would cripple bull chance flexibility next summer wondering since he essentially third string denver chance bull call offer second round pick nate anyone else similar could trade cover rose absence ryan davis  
 sam since would require salary match since nugget use nate seem like he scored double figure last five game assume would cost least jimmy butler tony snell think realistically try asik aaron brook deng boozer maybe shumpert stoudemires expiring contract deng andor boozer howard bealick  
 sam well stoudemires contract isnt expiring houston deal youre million short matching contract close trade deng hinrich houston asik lin think actually feasible scenario help team rocket get needed defender potentially two starter great leadership deng hinrich asik wasnt fitting howard lin value bench scorer he still overpaid slightly rocket option resigning letting walk fa think flexibility team fit would great selling point bull get guy lin could really boost trade value minute could fill badly needed void additional scorer create shot asik obviously one best defensive center league fit thibss system approach providing insurance jo bonus bull get asik lin one year decide use effort win simply trade without getting nothing unlike faced deng opts go elsewhere offseason kevin loughlin  
 sam course based back loaded contract pay asik lin combined million next season even mikhail prohorov laughing reckless spending houston potentially end nothing taking two player unrestricted free agent basically give away entire free agency class considered one best franchise history bull send deng jimmy butler detroit greg monroe expiring contract charlie villanuava bull send joakim noah toronto demar derozan detroit would solid starting drummond smith deng butler jennings toronto rumored looking deal player since got new gm may like idea jonas valanciunas noah inside adam schechner  
 sam boom reason rumor derozan he got long large contract though he high level scorer sense though looking deal there logic monroe deng given josh smith playing power forward thats heck gamble piston given deng unrestricted free agent though think toronto would much rather give rudy gay humongous contract dont fully understand cant move forward player like butler noah latter allstar player want acquire may seen noah absolutely dominate monroe bull win wednesday monroe say afterward tough play noah noah even playing best plus get forgotten regarding deng well he played yet depending market know hell ask salary sign trade sort option team dont trade since either like accepted season pretty much everyone involved deal limit dealing four five team might want something could see trade involving noah wouldnt need big return would trade thunder adam lamb cap filler considered jim mill  
 sam obviously money close couldnt done thunder clearly one frugal operation given gave james harden easily taking eight figure contract seem thrilled adam think youd take kendrick perkins theyd drive bull would trade away taj gibson luol deng take back eric gordon ryan anderson pelican would trade away ryan anderson eric gordon get back luol deng omer asik rocket would trade away omer asik get back taj gibson jerry becker

certainly unstated thats thats theyve got ok right righttheres moral victory would liked played better said mike dunleavy led bull point lose game five take hat great incredible shot buzzer beater hit shot going beat lot team buzzer beater end first buzzer beater end half footer good barometer one top team east team thats probably played best since new year opportunity play road feel play themso last day nba regular season bull unlike many team uncertainty regarding seeding playoff opponent rotation derrick rose continues progress told abc broadcaster probably play week bull orlando wednesday miami thursday home philadelphia saturdayeverything gone according plan bull coach tom thibodeau said game rose he got keep taking contact keep moving forward hopefully soon going play amount minute playing got injured weve got reestablish baseline something get foot wet start moving forward next part rehab actually play game stepbystep process derrick floor help team thats important thing like comeback got better went along hold true important thing comfortable enough he know dont expect playing minute night scoring ton point go give u thats good enough play make game easy everybodythe bull could used sunday though wry smile behind post game word player something notion could cavs full strength home winning streak without rose play leading scorer kyrie irving point well playoff opponent dont matter muchthe bull one game lead toronto raptor third east would likely mean first round series milwaukee winner likely playing cavs toronto tiebreaker bull virtue winning division move third bull would play wizard first round winner would likely face hawk second round survivor likely favored cavs conference finalsthats course lot ifs buts bull season left certainty bull fell road sixth road loss last eightweve gone lot year lot adversity lot adversity noah said seemed bit frustration exasperation guy come every day work hard keep progressing usually time everybody kind luxury know exactly who playing rotation stuff like dont luxury various reason weve got keep building still believe team keep fighting confident group know good team believe ourselvesso tinged vexation noah others knowledge rose kirk hinrich neither played sunday return week finally giving team semblance normalcy rotation go playoff theyll take chancesit would great play playoff noah said cavs exciting something really hope happens get court great place play basketball thats much love ill give cleveland opportunity present could play cleveland would happy team able thatthat seemed optimistic part underlying message third loss cavs four game season cavs got quiet triple double point assist rebound lebron james wasnt major factor barely grazed rim several jump shot jimmy butler well chasing james cavs seven fast break point usually deliberate bull bull however could contain cavs luck threepoint shooting irving jr smith latter added point combined three pointer cavs threessome thought defended well said bull coach tom thibodeau cavs three werent three heave went including irving shot put half court midway third quarterthat perhaps crucial juncture game bull bull committed five turnover stretch cavs went run take lead largest game rough sequence aaron brook otherwise played well point seven turnover dont blame brook he handled point guard duty well five week unexpected role change rose return give bull better court direction tougher defender career success irvingthere lot thing thought good said thibodeau rebounding bull defensive transition overall defense percent thought good position stretch win didnt close didnt close quarter well would liked cavs three end first second quarter thought good fight every time got made good run come back good sign ball movement really good assist every starter least four turnover hurt u youd like le bull probably got u couple costly one correct thatotherwise lot typical bullscavs ie lebronjames actually drew flagrant foul game nasty high elbow nikola mirotic second quarter close game cavs leading cavs would go spurt ahead halftime smith put footer halftime buzzer sort shot like see take made six eight three first halfthe bull smothered kevin love return back problem quiet point stuffed every time tried score inside typically doesnt much lift love make trio three pointer thought noah response three interesting opened window explanation defensive issue made bull team much le physical previous onesi think helped kevin love time said noah im used always help guy playing stretch four better job staying home man hit tough shot happens basketballin previous season noah center middle help play physically power forward he chasing away basket inclination help get caught deep time also explains play gasol le physical bull defense ceded time offensebut noah get chance physical cavs tough foul james early third quarter cavs leading official jumped james got seemed walk toward noah james walking free throw line shoot next possession noah would stop cavs fast break little hip check foul james though common foul really ordinary cavs coach david blatt game offered dramatic soliloquy sling arrow outrageous fortune heaped stari thought thing happened little overboard really blatt said afterward league take look theyll decide whats rightwe think guy doth protest muchit foul shrugged noah coming lane id rather shoot free throw get dunk basketball im trying hurt anyoneit really feeling getting bruised timethe bull actually play pretty well starting fast ahead barrage three began thibodeau ran nice side side action get catch shoot three favored dunleavy made four six three mirotic point rebound three three pointer though attempted nine bull cant get enough scoring day without rose tony snell remains ineffective noah scoring butler dragged minute hanging onto james held point including five last minute game basically decided though thibodeau said rose isnt coming back play minute bull desperately need scoring threat scoring get easier shot others gasol point nine rebound cavs got six point bench little indication may morethe bull closed lane james noah hedging help open three point shooting generally like smith attempting three thats beating playoffsnoah hustling floor loose ball pair fourth quarter three mirotic bull got within five point three minute left mirotic missed three butler gasol committed turnover cavs finally able relax love three left bull would rebound assist higher shooting percentage field free throw line though fewer three perhaps many jumper challenging slower cavs rim though help may way regard wellwe know fix said butler gave easy basket didnt execute way wanted confident group guy nobody locker room want go home early youve got go anyway theyre

tell he got bounce back greatwhat striking however unrestrained joy enthusiasm noah brought monday game something thats noticeable season noah immersed monday game waving towel standing front bench jumping defensive crouch like thibodeau encourage teammate shouting defensive instruction opponent talking constantly gesturing made shot easy jump connection back familiar role center bull offense noah better playerof course noah asked game tried deflect potential conflictsacrifices must made said noah get want get make sacrifice overall know big picture need guy whenever thibs call number ill readyit thus raise obvious questionanyone see gazelle streaking locker roomof whether number called first start gibsonjo taj great chemistry together noted thibodeauso start themplay gasol bench gibson nikola miroticthats really answer easy certain answer since gasol one best center league generally good idea play older veteran bench warms sits start mirotic noah rookie isnt starting bull doug mcdermott seems unlikely mcdermott well way mike dunleavy playedits game joakim noah eased training camp missed early season game playing time limited health recovery reason thibodeau noted difficult work offensive set noah compared gasol noah improvingin first four game noah averaged six point rebound assistsin past five game two missed noah averaging point rebound six assist exact number last five game noah averaging season point rebound assist last season averaged point rebound assist picture introduces player section team medium guidehes coming real fast said thibodeau last three four game really coming onthough butler thibodeau note also noah energy enthusiasm motivates inspires teammate noah maintain level zeal le demanding involved rolethese thing obviously worked rotation game pair noah gibson given noah playing time restriction thibodeau generally take noah late first quarter gibson play gasol rotates noah back gibson though gasol noah physical condition improves could change playing time confidence mirotic develops shot perhaps hell play gasol also excellent passer post draw double team though noah minute increase perhaps thibodeau stay primarily three big men call starter team leaguefor year bull seeking depth size post option offense dont want inhibit even occasionally doesnt smell exactly right  
  
 bull management wednesday explained news known mostly hardly unsurprisingly uncertainty going forward actually surprisingthe news bull intend bring back rajon rondo team option relatively small buyout contracttheres really good chance bring rajon back reason said executive vice president basketball operation john paxson get younger still really important quality veteran around young player man young people loved rajon great locker room great court guy took wing lot way responsible lot good thing came lot respect rajon especially belief game used drag guy weight room held accountable lot way really take lot himwhat known return coach fred hoiberg paxson supported emphasisfreds coach hell back paxson said opening statementwe made commitment fred whether weve given right roster maybe havent mentioned last year view young coach league like young player develop grow im going get specific thing weve seen think freds challenge offseason find way better leader think showed progress area team rally around time thats part process made commitment support thats organization worka big part uncertainty meanwhile option dwyane wade whether return highest paid player team million wade option though doesnt tell team draft seemed indicate post season session reporter return wade said could see necessary mentor young player word giving million hang lebron meit also seemed like bull would try retain restricted free agent nikola miroticwe value niko said general manager gar forman niko made clear want chicago made clear would like chicago thing align hope get something done july come certainly would hope niko would back forman also said bull hoped retain fellow free agent cristiano felicio though depending potential offerwhich didnt provide greater clarity question whether team willwould want towould even consider trading jimmy butler dont believe best player paxson basically said without hesitation there one closebut get treadmillwhen signed rondo wade last year understood coming reminded paxson already made deal robin lopez understood deal havent altered course dwyane option going sit talk thing jimmy u would love go get another superstar player go along right situation salary type thing thats difficult thing u managejimmy far away best player paxson reiterated he allnba type guy work ethic people know one best league job always keep thing open going sit jimmy going talk going define thought thats today respect jimmy respect opinion sit talk himwhich sounded like obvious seems occurred record position make anyone untouchable better knock u one come close sowhich could pretty much leave little room pursue free agent though bull consider option season sounded lot like another season patient perhaps substantial salary cap room next seasonand team without similar financial availabilitystrike like cavs warrior quite close spent yetweve got lot guy contract landscape make significant change right difficult think could massively move piece part realistic made statement last year investing young guy know sound like broken record truth brought five young kid roster two going add pick draft sacramento second lead u believe dont need change know change part dont want change without knowing exactly dont feel weve given young kid chance see know line scout drafted traded thats part job give opportunityno one saying still could playing rondo wasnt hurt boston lost doesnt seem like obvious change abandoning current roster change could kind help turn average much betterafter first season group player together butler wade rondo seemed finally figured late season play together respect one another stop communicating social medium perhaps comfort along certainty roster rotation enable team make sort leap could get position strike top free agent next season advantage fall bull open marketour expectation young guy consistent defined role said paxson much inconsistency rotation trying plug hole game game expectation organization going last season competitive also create environment young player grew developed competitive environment happened saw saw lot fan saw inconsistency play really team searching identity much season getting playoff always young group guy something learn always know thats goal gar committed reshaping roster continuing disciplined fashionit didnt suggest bull saying far away tighter rotation defined role youre starter youre reserve perhaps addition free agency trade periphery might see hoped see past seasonits fair say dont great shooting paxson agreed thats something lookout outside rondo point guard play push pace way fred want play yes continue look style want play look player fit last year maybe plug hole patchwork stuff maybe turn thats responsibility disjointed team ended winning seven last game boston rajon healthy end playing best basketball year excuse rajon go fall apart didnt support system behind help u win series sit say might still playing didnt happenso time panic use word process copyrighted 76ers bull noticed may also want didnt exactly say frequent medium suggestion dismantle team generally mean reporter cub game get towe discussion time said paxson opportunity right understand facing weve understood since last year decided change course say blow example dont get something return put u position really move forward cant weve talked jimmy ideally system fred want run need play pace push jimmy different player guy ball hand lot stretch game late year big assist game know value say blow easy say tough ityou see around league often six eight year get back playoff paxson pointed little bit lucky year draft hit youand player come nba sure scout excited draft loaded point guard perhaps game important position era bull know still need get good one rondo seemingly return he signed one season maybe start mentor young point guard like chicago bear nfl team appears quarterback draft forman say given late acquisition injury issue team give another look point guard cameron payne paxson said theyll continue search top level point guard also make clear audition going forward rotation consistentpaxson also disputed report team management structure changedim going make clear said paxson setup weve since gar named gm hierarchy responsibility reporting jerry michael reinsdorf gar responsibility reporting overlap every single day work well together much like business world ceo coo relationship responsibility lie mostly defining culture every day gar responsibility gm day day grind business role always ability say yes simplewithout naming team forman indicated summer team find locked long term deal perhaps bull strikeits feeling look going market going flatten way close time come youve got level flexibility going open lot opportunity wont hamstrung feel well advantageous situation know lot fan dont want talk cap cap situation spike managing think setting cap standpoint take advantage opportunity whether opportunity summer next year
